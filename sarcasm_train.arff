1,27_8_R3HIE3Q8O8BSJG.txt,' I bought this phone to replace one I had that was n\'t working well . I need to say though that I do not use this with a gophone plan . I have a regular family plan with AT & T and of course the customer service will not tell you that you can use a gophone as a replacement . If you are n\'t eligible for an upgrade they will tell you that you have to buy one at full price , usually $ 200 & up . Gophones work just fine , just do n\'t use the sim card that comes with it , put in the one from your old phone . It actually has directions inside the package that tells you how to use the gophone with your regular plan , and they credit the $ 50 airtime as like an extra 150 minutes to your plan . As far as the phone , I could n\'t be happier . The slide feature is great with the qwerty keyboard and the battery life has been great . We have three LG phones in our plan and they all use the same chargers , which is very convenient . ',normal
2,23_17_R1X9ZLCZH5VMIE.txt,' \'Commando Craps & Blackjack ! \' by John Gollehon is a good book in that some of the basic `` rules \'\' ( or disciplines as Gollehon calls them ) of gambling ( bide your time , start small and work your way up , avoid greed , set a predetermined \'loss \' limit , small wins are still wins , etc ... ) are sound advice for any gambler . However , in explaining the rules of craps , this book falls short in my opinion . The advise seems pretty elementary ( play the passline , play the odds , play the come line , etc ... ) , but does n\'t explain everything an inexperienced player needs to know about the game . Gollehon glosses over the prop bets ( mentioning only the Hardways and then actually contradicts himself . ) No mention of horn bets , C & Es , any sevens . For blackjack , the advise is really standard advise . Just type \'blackjack strategy chart \' on Google and print yourself out a chart . There . You \'re done . You have the \'optimum \' strategy for blackjack ( and you can take it into the casino with you ) . I would say that one should read the 1st half for the disciplines and basic gambling philosophies and then read a more detailed book for a greater understanding of the rules of blackjack and craps .

4,27_18_R1UO8C8V2V3SLD.txt,' I know that in most natural disaster flicks they do n\'t always get all of the technical details right , or they push the boundaries of reality a bit in order to tell a better story . I liked `` Volcano \'\' and `` Dante \'s Peak \'\' despite their taking of artistic license . They seemed to have consulted a scientist to at least learn the basics . But this made-for-TV tripe goes beyond belief into the realm of laughable drivel . Indeed , the only redeeming quality of the movie is that it is SO ridiculously wrong that you start laughing in disbelief at its stupidity . Here are some of the technical wrongs : ~In each earthquake , for some reason the richter scale is a variable number that increases as the earthquake progresses and then decreases as the earthquake comes to an end . In reality , the richter scale measures the total energy released through the entire event . It can only be determined after the fact . ~If I remember my geology classes correctly , a 10.5 earthquake is n\'t possible . ~When a fault line `` breaks \'\' it does not create a sinkhole that follows train tracks around curves and only stops when it finally swallows the train that it has been chasing . Get real . ~In the opening sequence , a cyclist outruns the earthquake waves . No way anyone could ride a bike that fast . The waves of an earthquake travel probably hundreds or thousands of miles an hour . I do n\'t know the exact number , but it \'s much faster than the 10 mph that a biker could go . ~Setting off a nuclear explosion would n\'t seal an earthquake fault . It would create thousands more . Anyway , this is just a taste of the inaccuracies that were inserted solely for theatrical effect . Unfortunately I was not on the edge of my seat out of suspense . I lost all interest in the movie after the first 10 seconds , but kept watching because I was given extra credit in geology for writing an essay about how terrible the movie was . ',ironisch

It also draws the full 15 amps , so plug it into a run that nothing else is pulling from . Overall I \'m very satisfied with this unit . ',normal

A seven page history of the Bible , and how the King James Version came to be . First published in 1611 , there were several subsequent revisions , and the version we read today is most like the 1769 revision . What it does not have that you would likely find in a better quality Bible : It has no cross-references , making it a poor Bible for study . The words of Jesus are not printed in red . It has no concordance . No maps . No ribbon marker . Many people use a modern language Bible for study , enabling greater clarity and understanding ( and I recommend the New King James Version , or the one I have used for years , the Amplified Bible ) , but the King James Version is nevertheless glorious in its language , should be read at least once in a lifetime , and is invaluable for comparison of texts , and though I feel it is a sadly short-sighted view , some consider the King James Version as simply great `` literature , \'\' comparing it to Shakespeare , and read it only for the beauty of its prose .

10,11_14_R23W7PMMD2THRH.txt,' I owned the K1 and then the K2 and love them both , so I was really looking forward to the DX . My plan was to use the DX at home , and keep my K2 for carrying all over creation with me . It was n\'t long , though , after my DX arrived the day before yesterday before disappointment set in . Do n\'t get me wrong , there is a LOT to like about the DX : 1 ) Pictures are awesome on it , if the publisher formats them properly . 2 ) Those who complain about darkness of text on their K2 ( a problem I \'ve never had , btw ) will be thrilled by the DX \'s very dark text . 3 ) The ability to rotate the screen is great . Gives you a closer look at things like maps and charts . 4 ) The browser is a bit faster than on the K1 or K2 , though that is n\'t saying much -- it is still very clunky to use . 5 ) But web pages look pretty good on the DX . 6 ) It holds 3500 books . BUT ..... the DX just is n\'t all that . It has drawbacks that are really making me consider sending it back before my 30 days are up : 1 ) First and foremost , while it is true that it natively reads PDFs , it is really only a PDF * viewer * . You ca n\'t change the font size on PDFs , links will not function on them , and the ability to magnify pictures does n\'t work on them either . So you better have LARGE fonts on your PDF before you load it . Looking at the PDF in horizontal mode helps a bit , but not by much . 2 ) The DX is too big to hold comfortably . It \'s not really all that heavy , but it is top heavy and you feel a pull on your hands . And that pull is really evident if you try to use the keyboard while holding it -- you practically have to lay the DX down flat , it becomes so difficult to type . 3 ) They merged the number keys with the QWERTY keys ( losing a line of keys ) . What development genius thought it would be helpful and an `` improvement \'\' to have to press the ALT key every time you wanted to type a number ? ! ? 4 ) Before my DX came , I really did n\'t think this would bother me at all , but I have to say : I really HATE the fact that the `` next page \'\' button is only on one side . I mostly use the left hand button . And yes , with the DX \'s rotation ability you can turn it upside down , placing the `` next page \'\' button on the left side .... However , when you do this , the button is so high up that you have to slide your hand ( not your thumb , your whole hand ) up in order to turn the page . May sound nit-picky , but it is truly a PITA to break off reading to do it . Not only that , but having the keyboard at the top makes it even more top-heavy than when it is right side up ! 5 ) when you rotate the DX so that it is horizontal , the `` next page \'\' button is either at the bottom or the top -- in either case you ca n\'t just flick your thumb and change the page . Again , a PITA . 6 ) If you leave the rotation feature on `` Auto \'\' when you are not using your DX it drains your battery , so you must remember to turn the feature off when you stop reading . 7 ) Still no folders . An organization nightmare three times bigger than that of the K2 ( which itself had increased the same problem on the K1 ) : the possibility of storing 3500 books but only being able to sort them by author , title , and `` most recent first . \'\' I will be fiercely debating with myself in the next week or so , on whether I really want to keep the DX . It is so disappointing . It has the potential of being a really great e-reader ... but as it stands now , it is n\'t . It \'s OK . But for $ 489 , it should be a lot more than merely OK . ',normal

13,48_17_R3IEYXSA1M58DI.txt,' Better than both `` Seven \'\' and `` Natural Born Killers \'\' , director Matthew Bright \'s `` Freeway \'\' is a looseleaf modern view of Red Riding Hood where Reese Witherspoon plays Red traveling to Grandma \'s house . Only she takes this trip after her prostitute mother and junkie stepdad are arrested , she escapes the cluthces of foster care , she says goodbye to her fiancee who is then murdered in a driveby shooting , she hitches a ride with a psycho who turns out to be a mass murderer , she kills a few people , ends up in lockup , escapes , finally makes it to Gradma \'s house , where some more bloody action takes place . Oh yes , she has homosexual and heterosexual sex , spends a lot of time saying the `` F \'\' word , brutalizes most anyone that gets in her way , and otherwise creates mayhem for everybody . Sounds like your typical Reese Witherspoon role , eh ? No , not by a long shot . But one thing about her role -- she is fantastic , out of this world great . She is twice the actress in this role she was playing June Carter Cash , for which she won an Oscar as best actress . On the basis of these roles , Witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now . As the description here and on Amazon indicates , this movie presses the envelope of the `` R \'\' rating as far as possible without slipping over into NC-17 . There is gory , bloody violence throughout this film , nudity and more `` F \'\' and `` F \'\' ing talk than you heard by Matt Damon when he played that low-class genius at Harvard . Someone told me they said `` F \'\' 147 times in that movie . Witherspoon herself must say it that many times here . But none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene , where junkie-hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo-junkie stepdad forces Reese to do the nasty while mom \'s out earning a living . There is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization , too , although it \'s clearly an over the top psycho young Sutherland plays . In an astonishing bit of casting , squeeky clean prom queen type Brooke Shields is cast as the uptight , upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester Sutherland , whose character is even more disgusting than Witherspoon \'s . While everyone wants Sutherland rubbed out , Witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities . Other players , incluidng Dan Hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place , contribute a lot to this film . This is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one Witherspoon plays actually exist . There is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie ; much of it seems upside down . But it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene , action you may never have seen in a film before . ',normal

15,276424_7_RPMQWVJTTZF18.txt,' For any American citizen who is currently in resignation or despair over the abundant examples of unethical , immoral and abusive leaders who breed cynicism and apathy , The Audacity of Hope is a breath of much needed oxygen . Senator Obama may be considered `` soft \'\' by the media who enjoy taking down anyone who exhibits complexity of mind , paradoxical thinking and humanistic values , yet his writing inspires one to stop wallowing in helplessness and take an active role in our imperfect democracy . When Obama first spoke at the Democratic convention , Ann Deavere Smith wrote an op ed piece the next day saying that politics would never be the same because finally a leader spoke with a `` unifying fusion \'\' beyond partisanship , stereotypes and blame mongering . The senator \'s writing demonstrates that reflective , thoughtful consideration of apparent opposites is a leadership attribute needed urgently -- Obama speaks of the need to redefine power from its corrupt , controlling misuse as currently witnessed daily to an inclusive power that practices empathy , tolerance , and a reclaiming of core democratic values . Obama leaves the reader with a call to face our critical global issues by polishing the lens of our own perceptions rather than projecting and perpetuating fear and hatred . Whether he will be able to pass great legislation or run for president , this book provides inspiration to any leader who wants to demonstrate a capacity to connect with the hearts , minds and souls of generations seeking to be inspired and uplifted . He embodies the true sense of enlightened - \'\' awake \'\' not perfect -- able to use his intelligence for the greater good while demonstrating the humility of one who knows his own shadows .

20,47_6_R4UV9LPOL5WTE.txt,' The King James Version of the Bible ( a.k.a . the Authorized Version ) is an English translation of the Bible published in 1611 . Commissioned by King James I of England , 54 scholars were approved by the king of whom 47 labored in six groups at three locations for seven years making use of both texts in the original languages and previous English translations . The result was a translation that had a marked influence on English style and literature because of its flowing language and prose rhythm , and was generally accepted as the standard English Bible for more than three centuries . When I was teaching A.P . English I strongly recommended to my students that the two supplemental texts they should have for class should be a copy of the King James Version of the Bible with a good concordance , and Edith Hamilton \'s `` Mythology . \'\' Of course in the age of searchable on-line texts such suggestions are of less value , but the religious and mythical allusions that appear in the works of Dante , Shakespeare , Milton and many other writers ( not to mention politicians such as Lincoln ) , can not readily understood unless you recognize them . Just in the first 11 chapters of Genesis we have two creation stories , the fall , the story of Cain and Abel , the flood , and the tower of Babel . All of these are major touchstone is contemporary literature . What is the biggest money making movie of all-time but a retelling of the story of the tower of Babel turned into the arrogance of the construction of a ship that supposedly not even God could sink ? As for our willingness to accept different versions of the same tale , I can argue that comes primarily from our reading of the four Gospels since billions more have done that then read the three extant Greek tragedies on the slaying of Clytemnestra by Orestes ( which everyone should also still be reading as literature ) . However , over the years I increasingly faced objections from students who felt that using the Bible as a reference book , or studying it as literature , was a waste of time since the Bible was not `` true \'\' ( as near as I can tell the distinction between `` true \'\' and `` True \'\' is not germane to their position ) . Of course , they failed to appreciate the irony that they were making this argument in a course devoted to studying the various forms of fiction . But the book of Job is a didactic poem set in a prose framing device , which to me indicates it is a lesson rather than a true story and suggests it can be considered an extant fictional narrative ( if not outright drama ) contemporary to the time of the great tragic poets in Athens . One that gets in the door as `` legitimate \'\' literature , the rest of the books of the Bible deserve the same consideration . To the extent that the Bible contains a coherent system of symbols , presents a tightly unified set of controlling themes , and explores the fundamental questions of human existence it functions as literature , without sacrificing its theological import . Ancient history has long been treated as literature of a kind , songs have always been considered poetic , and epistolary writing counts too . It should be kept in mind that while the Bible can be considered as literature as well as sacred writing there is also value in using the critical techniques of literature to read the Bible as scripture as well . The Bible is also important to the study of comparative religion , history , archeology , cultural anthropology , and other studies of the human condition . Most importantly , when it comes down to reading the Bible as literature there can really be no other choice than the King James Version . The eminence of this translation has been codified by such diverse entries as `` Bartlett \'s Familiar Quotations , \'\' which use the KJV as the source for all Bible quotations , and the character Linus in `` A Charlie Brown Christmas , \'\' use recites the story of the nativity from the KJV version of the 2nd chapter of Luke . At least to those of us who are Baby Boomers , this is the way the Bible should sound and the black imitation leather cover is appropriately old school as well . ',normal
21,2_5_R89J4G2H6U8YP.txt,' When I first saw the cover of this paperback in a Georgetown , DC , bookshop a few years ago , I was hesitant to buy it . Simply put , the cover is goofy , and does not do this masterpiece any justice . I am so grateful that I ignored my initial instinct , as I do n\'t remember ever reading a funnier book in the English language than the late John Kennedy Toole \'s life achievement , nor is there a more memorable character in American literature than I. J. Reilly . The work deserves a 6 star rating ! & quot ; A Confederacy of Dunces & quot ; is more than just incredibly funny , however . It is unusually poignant , gut-wrenchingly sad , and an admirable observation piece on a rather decadent and seemingly lost segment of our society sitting at the mouth of the Mississippi River . I have visited New Orleans three times since 1994 for varied reasons , and the city apparently has not changed in the least since Mr. Toole \'s late 1960s rendition . His characters continue to stroll and struggle along Bourbon Street and Canal Street , and their troubled spirits infuse every alley and cave of the French Quarter . Just like the district surrounding St. Peter \'s Square in the city of jazz , Ignatius J. Reilly is out of step with the rest of America . In spite of his repulsive and grossly comical physical presence , he believes in aesthetics and real meaning , in what he perceives to be the truth . For this reason , he is a true literary hero , like Don Quixote , Cyrano de Bergerac and the Good Soldier Schweik before him .

OH YEAH , `` Battle Royale \'\' by Koushun Takami , `` The Long Walk \'\' by Steven King , `` Lord of the Flies \'\' by William Golding , the movie The Condemned , et cetera . \'\' This is plagiarism at its worst , I mean this book has been written a thousand times , and she did n\'t even try to change any circumstances . ... And now she is being recognized as inspirational , bringing a `` completely new concept \'\' of kids killing kids ? ? IT \'S BEEN DONE ! It disgusts me that no one has sued her for this second-rate version of amazing literature . Also , if she \'s going to completely steal their story lines , she could at least do it well ; Her writing is terrible . Not only that , but she \'s using a textbook example of a dystopian society . Like , there \'s not a thing that makes this society new or different . It \'s all so cliche ! Ca n\'t she think of a single new concept ? I mean , putting things in the blender is n\'t a skill . Well , that pretty much ends my rant . Please , if you \'re going to buy something , buy an original ! Try Battle Royale , that \'s a personal favorite of mine , but whatever you do , do n\'t buy this unoriginal cra p . Congratulations , Suzanne ! You \'ve just proven that idiots without brains in their heads can be successful too ! ',ironisch
23,12_1_R2OF8Z87UZVJJA.txt,' Bottom Line : The author really did n\'t have enough time to let this mature , and did n\'t have a good editor . You need both to create something really enduring . I read an article the other day in the Dallas Morning News about the disposable book : how publishers are now out to milk authors for all they can get in the short-term , with no thought to longevity or sustaining a publishing relationship . I \'m sad to find this so true . I was pretty much overwhelmed by fellow teachers who are obsessed ; I was actually awed the other day when two colleagues got into feverish exchange over whether Bella should ultimately choose Edward or Jacob . It was at that point that my own fate was sealed and I knew I had to read it . I digested it in less than a two-day period , and now I will quickly outline the Good , the Bad and the Ugly : The Good I \'m surprised at the people who attack Meyer \'s characterization . She \'s actually pretty good at it . For the most part , her characters are fun , well-rounded , dynamic , complex -- everything you want in a good story . Bella is believable and easy to like . I find it easy to identify with her , but as abnormal as I am , I can see how if I identify with her , others might find her completely foreign and unbelievable . : ~ ) The only weakness that sneaks in Meyer \'s characterization lies with the bad guys ; they \'re given very little opportunity to develop in relationship to the rest of the novel . Additionally , Meyer is very good at creating suspense . If nothing else , the book is a great page-turner . The reader is hypnotically bound to follow through simply by the sheer force of the words on the pages . The story itself is very easy to get lost in . Meyer definitely hit on an intriguing story-line . It \'s different , it \'s compelling . Unfortunately , it just was n\'t enough . The Bad Meyer works a little too hard to make her \'good \' vampires altruistic . There is a lot of explaining away , a lot of conveniences that in small doses do no harm , but over the long haul add up like water wearing down a rock . Further , the book is a little verbose for the material . A great deal of condensing could have been done to the book \'s benefit . Moreover , there are several places in the book that are meant to be one thing ( like romantic ) and come off as another ( cringe-inducing ) . I sometimes felt like I was watching a personal fantasy , and whoa , that \'s not my thing .... The Ugly Here \'s the rub : As much Meyer tries to make Edward good , nothing can atone for what he is . For Bella and Edward to go on forever the way they are is an impossibility . Everyone knows something has to give . The option given in the book , for Bella to become a vampire , is n\'t really allowable from a publishing standpoint . Think about it : The target audience is young adult . Most young adult readers are female . For Bella to become a vampire would send a message to millions of young girls that in order to \'get the guy \' you have to cut yourself off from everyone who has previously cared about you and go through physical suffering and die an eternal death , going from human to soulless companion . Yikes ! The political repercussions have me betting that Bella wo n\'t become a vampire anytime soon . The author has really written herself in a corner here , which would n\'t be fatal ( no pun intended ) if she could come up with something truly supernatural and redemptive for Edward to bring him back to Bella \'s level . But that \'s not so glamorous in today \'s climate . : ~/ There are other smaller problems , such as Edward \'s schizoid transformations from angry to humored and back , and the fact that ( maybe I \'m alone ! ) no matter how hard I tried , I could n\'t envision a deathly pale and anemic looking guy who \'s really cold to be anywhere near attractive or sexually appealing or anywhere in Greek god territory . It could have something to do with the fact that my husband is a gorgeous blonde who just emanates vitality , and I \'m too used to that , but I still found it so difficult to reconcile that it stood out to me . It seemed to me that these , and other smaller plot points , could all have been resolved with time and editing . I also found it unthinkable that there would have to be 3 sequels to resolve anything . There does n\'t seem to be enough material to work with there while satisfying curious readers who really just want to know if there \'s any way for Bella and Edward to be together . This is a great summer read for fun , but it pains me because it really could have been so much better . Overall , Meyer is an impressive author , but this is yet another read that goes into the \'good-but-could-have-been-genius \' category . ',normal

30,5_3_R2DA2Y1CHNNYGY.txt,' I purchased the Polaroid PoGo today and have done a fair bit of `` playing \'\' with this compact little printer over the past couple of hours . In fact , I have already used the first package of 10 sheets of Zink ( Zero Ink ) paper that come with the printer . So my first recommendation is ; if you are planning on buying a PoGo , I highly recommend getting extra paper so you can get through your `` testing \'\' phase without having to purchase more paper . However , do n\'t go crazy and buy too much , there are expiration dates on the paper which may affect your picture quality if you take to long to `` expose \'\' ( print ) them . Connectivity : I have tested the Bluetooth capabilities with my Motorola Q , Laptop Computer ( Bluetooth enabled ) , my desk-top Windows Vista computer ( with Radio Shack `` Bluespoon \'\' Bluetooth 2.0 adaptor added ) and my PictBridge capable Canon Powershot A 640 camera ( directly connected to PoGo via USB cable ) and the printer worked like a charm in all of the above tests ! Speed of Printing : Print time is about 1 minute per photo . There was no noticeable change in print speed with any of the tests I performed . Using the Bluetooth ( wireless ) connection or plugging in your USB cable directly from your camera did not seem to make any difference as to how fast the image printed . Image Quality : Not great ... but not the worst I have seen either ... The pictures I printed from my camera ( via USB connection ) looked better than my pictures from my cell phone , but this was likely due to the higher megapixel image created by my camera versus the 1 megapixel image from my cell phone . However , the `` white balance \'\' of both my camera and cell phone images were a little `` off \'\' . The whites were extremely white ( almost washed-out ) and the dark ( shadow areas ) were very dark . So if you stay away from printing bright `` beach / snow \'\' images or dark `` night \'\' photographs you will be OK . Photos with lots of color ( flowers , for example ) looked pretty good when printed with the PoGo . Cool things to do : The adhesive on the back of the photo paper is a nice feature of this product . This makes it possible to add pictures to your hand written journals . You can stick them to business card magnets and put photos all over your refrigerator . You can make photo luggage tags , cards and much , much more . If you do n\'t need the highest quality image , but want to do some fun , creative stuff with photographs I would definitely recommend the PoGo . If you are a photographer hoping that the PoGo would give you a quick `` proof \'\' of what your printed images will look like , then this printer is probably not for you , since the image quality is not as good as you could get with some standard ink jet printers . Have fun ... ',normal

1195,46_2_R2C2RWTGYXCIES.txt,' When I do not feel like carrying my heavy SLR camera and lenses , I take my Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 instead . With the 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens , the G1 is about one-third the weight of my Sony A900 SLR with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens . Of course , the G1 \'s 12 megapixel sensor can not compete with the A900 \'s 24 megapixel sensor , and the 14-45 lens is neither as fast as , nor of equal quality to , the 24-70 lens , but the portability of the G1 means that I take it with me more often than I take my A900 . The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag fits the G1 with 14-45 lens perfectly and attaches to my belt via a Velcro strap . And the Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for all Canon Camcorders is a convenient alternative if you do n\'t want a camera strap around your neck . If I were to list all of the features of the G1 that I like , this review would be rather long , so here is a short list of my favorite features : 1 . All of the buttons that control focus , metering , ISO , etc . are well positioned and easy to use . 2 . A real time histogram may be displayed if desired . 3 . In manual focus mode , the image is magnified in the high resolution electronic viewfinder so that precise focus may be achieved . 4 . If desired , images may be stored in RAW ( RW2 ) format in addition to the limiting JPEG format . The RAW alternative allows for better noise suppression ( see below ) . A consequence of the small 14-45 lens is that the lens is not particularly fast and so does not permit low light photography . However , the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras remedies this problem . Also available are the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras and Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras lenses that extend the zoom range to 14-400mm ( 35mm equivalent ) . And the camera plus all four lenses weigh a mere four pounds , so can easily be taken along on a hike . For those who would like to capture video , the Panasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video , Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm Lens and the somewhat larger Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD are attractive alternatives . But I do n\'t shoot video , so the G1 is a low priced solution to my need for a portable camera . The two weaknesses of the Panasonic G1 are : 1 . The dynamic range of the sensor is a bit limited , with the consequence that it is fairly easy to blow out the highlights in an image . I have n\'t found a good solution to this problem , other than to shoot in RAW mode and underexpose at bit when I want to capture cloud detail . 2 . The sensor introduces a fair amount of noise above ISO 800 . However , this problem is nicely remedied if one shoots in RAW mode and uses Adobe Lightroom 3 to suppress noise . This approach easily extends the useful ISO from 800 to 1600 , and in some cases to 3200 . Update : Panasonic has recently introduced the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Lumix G VARIO f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens ( Black ) and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G10 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 14-42mm Lumix G Vario f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens cameras . Both of these cameras can record video . Also , it appears that the Sony Alpha NEX-3 and NEX-5 cameras , with their APS-C sensors , provide better image quality than any of the Panasonic cameras . However , as of this writing , the Sony system does not provide as broad a zoom range as does the Panasonic system . ',normal

41,3_4_REBAMEZU2XO9B.txt,' Presidents ( and those aspiring ) these days can not live as real people . Like the Gods of Greek legend , they have to live in a mythology of their own creation . A Mythology is usually created to explain what is beyond the comprehension of the normal human or to hide secrets that `` mere mortals \'\' must be protected from . This book presents the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton as a mythology . If your a candidate for president today , one of the requirements is a book that tells a false inspirational version of your life story . The books spin every event in the person \'s life to make political points or to shore up what the campaign considers weaknesses . In saying this , I \'m singling out this book or Hillary Clinton . She is by far not the only candidate with a book like this out right now . The strange thing about Hillary Clinton is that almost nobody really knows her . This book does n\'t help . Bernstein follows the established baby boomer script . She was born in an imaginary world of the 1950s that showed up in educational films and the TV show `` Happy Days \'\' . Like all Boomers , she had a bad father who we are now told was more abusive and cruel than we were told he was before . Her mother was ( by the script ) a good caring person . Then she discovers the civil rights movement , Martin Luther King Jr and the turmoil of the 1960s . Thats the script , but it never really happened that way . From other books , the more accurate picture is of the churchy `` good girl \'\' from the midwest whose political beliefs were rooted in an attempt to make the world better by `` good works \'\' . The book then presents an utterly false account of life at Wellesley . The script has her flowering as a powerful woman ready to take on the world . The book captures the nostalgic view of the times , but not in any way the reality of that time . Berstein spins her up into the spokeswoman for her generation and a national figure in college but again it did n\'t happen that way . We are then presented with an account of her decision to move to Arkansas that again rings false . Yale Law grads that go to New York or Washington at graduation do n\'t go there for idealism , they go there to make money . Neither is a place where she would have found a political future except as a consultant or a lobbyist . Bernstein then gives a false account of her time in Arkansas which does not deal with the realities of what that meant to her or the adjustments she had make in her life ( and appearance ) to enhance Bill Clinton \'s electability . When the scene shifts to Washington , we are given a spin version of the first two disasterous years of the Clinton presidency and a apologist version of her role in that disaster . Everything has a scripted excuse or explaination . In terms of her qualifications to be president , her failures in 1992-1994 raise the most questions . Explaining away all the problems , as Berstein does , is not helpful . The health care initiative she ran was the biggest ( and perhaps only ) organization she ran in her life and reading the book its unclear if Berstein ( or her ) understand all of what she did wrong . We are then presented with the usual false account of the marriage . She ( and the book ) play her as the victorian martyr wife tricked by the devious husband . Whatever really goes on in the marriage has never been covered accurately in my opinion by any book . False positive or false negative , what they all have in common is that they ring false . Then we have the happy ending . She is carried into the senate apparently on a wave of `` sympathy \'\' . If you want to read about the strong-arming and backroom democratic politics that went into her senate candidacy , this is n\'t the book that will tell you . The book ends with the heroic sunset photo of her with her valued advisor , husband by her side , preparing to `` save \'\' the world by running for president . This book is like a sappy made-for-TV movie about the life of Hillary Clinton . This is a person who cries out for a real biography but all we get is either demonization from right-wing cranks or political spin like this book . Her real life story ( an honest one ) would be an interesting read , but to be honest it would not serve her purpose or get her elected . It would be nice of our presidents and presidental aspirants could return to being human beings .

44,42_13_R2WFA5PWCDPZC1.txt,' The post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go . I \'ll give movies of this type some slack I would n\'t always give other kinds , so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday ( in which Malcolm McDowell appeared , as he does here ) still has its interesting moments . But if it \'s a good one such as I Am Legend , I \'m really into it bigtime . So I \'ve been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared , and now that I \'ve seen it there were many things about it I liked . Start with the mythic prophet main character . His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on . Those scenes were generally pretty cool , and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film . ( Any more fight scenes would have bored me . ) Eli \'s story plays out with a kind of grim determinism , although it also has hopeful elements as well . I was glad I was n\'t previously familiar with the story , as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise . Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead . Other roles were well cast too , including ( to my surprise ) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman \'s bad boss character . Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego , madness & desperation . Anyway , as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie , it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world ( ex. , chapstick yes ; cigarette lighter , not so much ) , and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film . All in all , it was n\'t quite the adventure I was expecting ( with occasional pacing issues ) , but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience . ',normal

His book on Rush Limbaugh , though now inaccurate due to Limbaugh \'s weight loss , grabbed attention just by its sheer rudeness . Now he takes on the entire right wing with his new book . I mean , really , is it any big secret that politicians are lying to us ? Franken \'s real problem is that he paints just as broadly as those he attempts to indict . The mark of a great political satirist ( and there are n\'t many ) is to point out the folly of our leaders/public figures without making us hate you while you do it . Here Franken utterly fails .

1104,2_4_R1CY66TNX7N4RX.txt,' The Nintendo Wii is the most inexpensive of the current generation of gaming consoles . It provides motion sensing controllers and 480p graphics . We tested the Wii before its launch day ( I \'m a game reviewer ) , and we had our own unit in our home the morning of launch day . Here are our findings . The Wii is designed around a menu of `` channels \'\' . There is of course the game-playing channel , where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game . Simply load the disc in and go . There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing . The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV . Other channels for news , weather , and online shopping require an interent connection ; the news and weather were not actually working at launch time . The system does NOT have a regular network cable port , which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have . Instead , it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter . I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter ! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically . With the PS3 , you have to pay extra for the 60 gig unit to get this built in . The XBox 360 requires extra hardware as well . It \'s hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy . That being said , the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun and is about as basic as you can get . You swing at baseballs , lob tennis balls , bowl , box and play golf . A `` fitness \'\' mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age , sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age . If you did both every day , you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible ! In a world where video games = couch potato , it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active . You do n\'t lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games . Boxing can be quite strenuous , jabbing , blocking and weaving in real life . Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements . Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports , but even there you are standing , moving , swinging . You get your heart going at least a little , and get some exercise . My boyfriend had a sore arm after playing for a number of hours , in a good way , as he would from exercising . The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like the other two systems . It \'s something you accept when you \'re paying such a low price for the console . But really , it \'s not that big a deal . I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay , even though you ca n\'t see the pores in Link \'s face . If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments , 480p is DVD quality and is quite good . If you really , really crave high definition super realism in your games , then the Wii might not be the best choice for you . However , if you \'re fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them , the 480p can show that quite nicely . For example , there are n\'t fans in the stands for baseball - there are colored blocks . Nintendo has always been known as a `` Kid \'s Console \'\' - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a `` Family Console \'\' . It \'s not just kids who will enjoy this . Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything `` Tricky \'\' about how to use a video game unit . It \'s very intuitive . Moms can easily play with their kids , each with their own Wii profile . Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around . Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine . Every person who has come over - from 8 to adult - has instantly understood and enjoyed the Wii , without much explanation at all . With the price tag being so low , a gaming household that `` needs \'\' a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify to get a Wii for the fun , casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends . Well recommended ! Since I own all three systems , and am playing all three wirelessly , feel free to contact me if you have any further questions . ================ Update : One year later , and the Wii is still going strong ! It \'s really funny how many people said the Wii would bomb because it was n\'t as good as the PS3 or 360 - and here we are a year later and the Wii is still the system that people are really wanting to get . Hospitals are getting Wiis for their patients to play with . Senior centers are getting Wiis for their residents to play games together with . I was just on a cruise ship and they had Wii tournaments going on every day ! This is a fantastically fun system that we really enjoy playing with and that literally the whole family can have fun with . There are great games for kids , great games for teenagers , great games for adults . I am really very pleased with how the Wii has held up and the game set available for it . Update 2 : 2 years later ! Our Wii is still adored in our household , used just as much as the PS3 and XBox 360 . I was just at a bar and they had two Wiis set up for people to play with , and everybody loved them . This really is an `` every person \'s gaming system \'\' . I \'m running out of space here , but my nintendo.bellaonline.com site has full articles on exactly what you get in this box , and what else you should buy so you have a full system to play with .

Despite some significant accomplishments during his administration , there was confusion , ineptitude , cronyism , lack of vision , and downright corruption . I was on the one hand proud of Clinton for things like his extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit , which lifted so many low-income families out of poverty , and on the other hand absolutely enraged by the dithering and delay and lack of action in Afganistan , Iran , Iraq , Bosnia , and Rwanda that contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths , thereby emboldening Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to commit acts of mass murder on our own soil .

So I was incredibly excited when the friend who had given me the game invited me to her house to play her copy on her computer . I played for all of 20 minutes , and then stopped . Create-A-Sim is probably my favorite part of the Sims series . I was extremely disappointed in this feature on the Sims 3 . In the Sims 2 , I enjoyed how the sims \' features could be cartoonishly distorted to create some very unique sims . In the Sims 3 , they all look the same to me . Pudding faces and muddy hairstyles . I was also highly disappointed in the selection of hairstyles and clothing . The color customization of all items and the traits feature was pretty neat , but that \'s about it . Most of all , I loved the feeling of being God in the Sims . That all the actions , relationships , etc . of every sim was dictated by me . I became attached to my sims because I knew that their failures and successes were dependent upon me . I felt like that was ripped away from me in the Sims 3 with the new Story Progression feature . Even though this option can be disabled , from what I have heard households and relationships are not as they were in the Sims 2 . I would hate to become attached to a sim I \'ve created and have them suddenly move away . I certainly hope EA can fix some of our concerns in upcoming expansion pakcs .

62,276426_4_R20Y16BCNX1SGM.txt,' I have read 100 \'s of very poor books on the Laws of Attraction in the last few years .

I have used what I learnt from my extensive reading , coupled with academic qualifications , business and psychology experience , to create a consulting company , teaching seminars to corporations in strategic thinking , marketing , goal setting and business development . I also use the principles to help individuals , by guiding them as a Life Coach , teaching people cognitive methods to help goal set and enhance their lives beyond what they could do on their own . As such , I read as many books as I can on a variety of subjects to enhance my knowledge . I can honestly say , that with all that experience , this DVD , is good as an introduction to the concept , BUT it is not as good as a book like Law of Attraction in Action , which I feel covers all bases needed for the LOA to work . Many people in my experience can not get the LOA to work , as they have too much OLD subconscious programming blocking the process . You can use the Sedona Method to unblock this old rubbish in the brain , but this DVD , does not cover this area .

66,38_4_R4HE2SNJ7RJPD.txt,' I needed a small freezer for storing excess frozen blueberries from a bulk purchase so after researching different makes and models , I finally decided to purchase the Haier mini-freezer from Amazon . Amazon offered free shipping and the price of the unit was $ 20 cheaper than my local walmart and target . It was very good customer service for Fedex sending two employees to deliver the mini-freezer so it arrived in excellent condition even though the way the mini-freezer was packaged from Haier was the worst I \'ve ever encountered . There was absolutely no foam or packing material to protect the unit and after cutting one plastic strap the card board box fell apart . After inspecting the unit for damage , I found one small dent near the top-right of the freezer door ( See the images that I \'ve posted above ) . I proceeded to follow the instruction booklet and plugged it in . I filled the mini-ice tray ( Included with the unit ) with water and left it in the freezer . Two hours later I checked to make sure the unit was still working and noticed the water had already frozen so now I have mini-ice cubes ^_^ I thought it would be helpful to include the mini-freezers interior measurements for usable space : I \'ve measured the freezers interior top half at 15 inches wide with a depth of 12 inches , while below the removable wire shelf the bottom half measures 15 inches wide with a depth of only 7 inches ( Usable space is lost due to the units motor ) . Pros- The unit is very quiet . It looks nice and the handle is built into the top of the door . The hinge can be moved to the opposite side depending on which way you prefer the door to open . It has a switch in the back which allows temperature adjustment from 1-7 ( I have it set on 4 ) . It has a removable wire rack inside the freezer . Cons- Some of the space in the lower section of the freezer is lost to the units motor . I \'m very happy so far with my purchase and recommend this mini-freezer to anyone that needs a little additional freezer space , but keep in mind there is a high percentage chance it will arrive with a dent > _ & lt ; .

1085,24_5_RYHEHPZQFGDJL.txt,' I picked up the DVDs for the first two `` Anne of Green Gables \'\' series after seeing the musical version of the story in Charlottetown . I lucked out because the DVDs have been out less than a month . The actual film , of course , is worth 5 stars all by itself and is a classic adaptation of a beloved novel , so what I want to talk about is why Anne \'s fans should pick up the DVD version as well . There are cast bios , previews of the other `` Anne \'\' works by Sullivan films , and some production stills . However , the chief charms of the DVD version are the following : First , there is Megan Follows \' audition for the part of Anne , which is fascinating to see her first attempts at nailing the character of Anne Shirley . You will notice considerably changes in her actual performance , but the raw talent is amply displayed . Second , there are missing scenes , most of which have to do with the wife of Reverend Allen . It seems the production was co-produced by a German company and so there was this extended subplot with Mrs. Allen , played by a German actress , that was fully integrated into the Germany version of `` Anne of Green Gables . \'\' Third , there is Directors Commentary from Kevin Sullivan and the film \'s editor , although the latter is there mainly to given the director someone to talk to during the almost four hour film . The commentary is certainly fascinating , as we find out where certain scenes were short ( mostly around Toronto , but some on Prince Edward Island ) , when scenes were shot ( Megan would have to play Anne at 16 in the morning and 12 in the afternoon ) , as well as great stories about Colleen Dewhurst leaving a scene about to explode in laughter or adding a line . However , for all these fascinating tidbits about the production you will find yourself surprised from time to time that Kevin Sullivan often does not have a clue about the story of Anne and why it works . He expresses surprise , for example , that audiences find the scene where Anne thanks Matthew for the dress with puffed sleeves to be so emotional . Sheesh . She is looking at him with absolute love and devotion in her eyes and he says , `` Do n\'t you like it . \'\' Of course it gets to you . But not Sullivan apparently . Still , the commentary is first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and using it to track down sites I intend to visit later this week in Toronto ( I am going to find THE BRIDGE ! ) . Finally , there are some behinds the scenes clips . Warning , this was a television news story on the production and is not the excellent behind the scenes documentary that aired on PBS . Obviously , my only complaint with this DVD is going to be the exclusion of that documentary , which , I supposed , belonged to PBS and not Sullivan productions . So , I know that most of you reading this not only already have `` Anne of Green Gables \'\' on videotape , you have had it for a long time .

In a nutshell , the story is this : Tommy Walker is born while his father is off on some journey ( ` It \'s a boy \' ) from which he becomes several years late in returning . Tommy \'s mother takes up with a lover , father returns , mother and lover kill father with Tommy as a witness , and mother and lover tell Tommy he saw and heard nothing ( ` You did n\'t hear it \' ) . Tommy becomes functionally blind , deaf , and dumb to all outside appearances , however , it is evident that within his own head , he can see and hear everything ( ` There \'s a doctor I \'ve found \' ) . He is tormented by various malicious relatives ( ` Cousin Kevin \' and ` Fiddle About \' ) and ` treated \' by various attempts , including hallucinogens ( ` Acid Queen \' ) . As he grows up , the only outside experience to which he responds is a pinball machine , at which he becomes expert ( ` Pinball Wizard \' ) . Tommy is finally cured by watching his image in a mirror smashed by , I believe , his mother \'s lover ( ` Smash the Mirror \' ) . Being released from his isolation for Tommy is like being released from a practically lifelong mystical experience heightened by pinball . The charisma with which Tommy is imbued by this experience leads him to become a ` New Messiah \' ( ` Sally Simpson \' ) creating a movement which expands beyond local resources ( ` Welcome \' ) and becomes institutionalized into a ritual modeled after playing pinball while deaf dumb and blind ( ` Tommy \'s holiday camp \' ) . The story ends with a revolt of Tommy \'s disciples against his new religion ( ` We \'re not gon na take it \' ) . The theme of being oppressed runs throughout practically all of Townshend \'s work , although in ` Tommy \' , it takes a back seat to mysticism . The people who dote on the philosophical background of ` The Matrix \' should sink their teeth into the ` Tommy \' story and ruminate on that a while . The major musical theme of the work seems to be Townsend \'s search for a magical chord . And , anyone who , like myself , has seen ` Tommy \' performed live by the original Who will have no trouble believing Townsend has found his chord as he hits that first great whirlwind chord in ` Pinball Wizard \' . Talk about a rush ! In general , a lot of the music echoes earlier Who works . Townshend seems to constantly cut and paste phrasings from one work to another and I have no problem with this except in the most tedious of the three instrumental pieces ( ` Underture \' ) in the album . Some writers have said that \'Tommy \' is more like an Oratorio or a Song Cycle than it is an Opera , but I disagree . Neither of these other two genres requires a plot , and an Opera does , and Tommy has a plot . I prefer to think of it as a selection of arias and instrumental passages from which some bridging dialogue has been left out . My biggest problem with this plot is that the actual event that triggers Tommy \'s autism is only hinted at in the most vague of terms . It is easy to believe that it was a murder , but the lyrics of ` You Did n\'t Hear It \' never come even close to saying exactly what the event was . On the other side of the coin , the great majority of the songs on the album ` Tommy \' directly support carrying the story forward . Practically the only exception is the Sonny Boy Williamson classic ` Eyesight to the Blind \' . It is probably symptomatic that only ` Pinball Wizard \' , ` I \'m Free \' , and ` Sensation \' out of the 24 cuts in ` Tommy \' really work for the Who outside the context of the whole work . That \'s why I \'m especially happy to have seen The Who perform virtually the whole album live , four days after it was initially released . It is also interesting to see that the two cuts describing episodes of sadism were written by Entwistle and not Townshend . This CD contains exactly what was on my original vinyl two record album bought in 1969 , suitably enhanced with modern electronics . My greatest respect for Townshend is for creating a classic musical form , the Opera , using an entirely ROCK instrument , with the slightest classical leavening from John Entwistle \'s French horn on a few early numbers . So many ` rock \' versions of traditional forms simply overlay rock performances on classical arrangements or make classical arrangements of rock melodies . Aside from ` Quadrophenia \' , the only other work which succeeds at doing this is Spooky Tooth/Pierre Henry work ` Ceremony An Electronic Mass \' . Listening to this album and every other early Who album reminds one just how much their performances were a collaborative effort between the original four , and how much we miss Keith Moon and John Entwistle today . We can only say that with ` Tommy \' and numerous other works and recorded performances , the memory of The Who will live forever . Seminal work in the history of Rock . ',normal

For the past couple of years I had been using a big , clunky top-rated ( by Consumer Reports ) Sears Kenmore vacuum on the main level of our home , but as the attachments on the Kenmore would fall apart while in use , I quickly relegated that vacuum to the basement .

86,32_9_R196O16O1FBFG5.txt,' At a certain point , a marvelous band will get a reputation so overwhelming , it \'s simply not possible for them to keep topping themselves . And from the sound of `` In Rainbows , \'\' Radiohead has decided not to let their reputation loom over them -- and I \'m not just talking about the online digital release . In their latest album , they reinvent their bittersweet pop sound -- they lose some of the trappings of their past work , in favour of warmer , more intimate melodies and traditional instrumentation . It opens on an angular note with `` 15 Steps , \'\' which is built around a jagged riff.The first couple minutes are full of fuzzy synth stabs and sharp drums , sounding like a jazz number that \'s being eaten by a computer . `` How come I end up where I started ? /How come I end up where I went wrong ? \'\' Thom Yorke sings mournfully . `` You reel me out then you cut the string ... \'\' But then the guitars slide in and twine through the song , softening it into something very different . The scratchy synth beats and subtle guitar start building to a slow crescendo , staying energetic and almost reggae-esque right to the end . See it as kind of a transition song for Radiohead ; they \'re easing listeners into their new acoustic sound , rather than just dropping us in . But after that , they pretty much leave the `` Kid A \'\' territory behind them -- `` Bodysnatchers \'\' is an intense rocker brimming with chunky riffs and softly ringing guitars . It \'s a gorgeous piece . After that , the songs gently slip down into more introspective territory -- smooth , dark pop songs wrapped in a heavy blanket of fluid strings and subtle slide guitar . Some of these are dressed up in thick guitars and clattery drums . `` Jigsaw Falling Into Place drops the strings for a vibrant guitar-rocker edged with synth , and it all finished up with the quivering , melodic finale `` Videotape . \'\' You know , I did n\'t think that Radiohead could surprise me . So many bands get mired in their best-known sound , and they keep turning out the same ol \' because that is what the fans expect . But Radiohead has not only made an exquisitely bittersweet pop album , but they \'ve also injected vitality back into their sound . They sound brand new . Particularly , they \'ve almost abandoned the cool , alien synth of their last few albums . It \'s still there in patches , but it \'s quietly overwhelmed by the layers of slide guitar , streams of piano , and smooth sweeps of elegant strings . These are seamlessly woven with clattering drums and cymbals , thick crunchy riffs . And yes , occasionally a little speck of synth . But their songwriting is much the same -- simple , yet oblique ( `` I am a moth who just wants to share your light ... I only stick with you because there are no others/You are all I need \'\' ) . While Yorke \'s trademark wail is still in place , he sounds more melancholy and contemplative than outright woe-is-me angsty . He even sounds a bit cheerful in `` Weird Fishes/Arpeggi . \'\' Most long-standing bands ca n\'t summon up a new sound , and new freshness , this far into their careers . But Radiohead have created a quiet little masterpiece in `` In Rainbows \'\' -- beautiful , quiet , and melancholy . ',normal

A demonic entity named Yahweh sets humanity up with the perfect trap : the Tree of Life . Knowing they \'ll eat the otherwise purposeless fruit , he slaps them with a generational curse that binds them to his malevolent will ! What follows is the most twisted tale of evil ever written ! Yahweh , egotistical and ragingly jealous , uses those under his control to rape and pillage cultures that do n\'t worship him . Men , women and animals alike were slain in these bloodthirsty raids . The only hope you had was being a virgin woman whom Yahweh encourages to be conquested [ Deuteronomy 21:10-13 ] , [ Deuteronomy 20:13-16 ] . If you have a hard time reading about cruel animal and human sacrifices , perverted sexual references and the murder and abuse of children I suggest not picking this up . This is a true tale of horror and our villian is far from tactful ! However , Yahweh \'s not a transparent , homocidal manaic .

91,45_3_R2DUM7S4XW06QN.txt,' There were many reasons I decided to purchase a Kindle - my hands ache when holding a book open , I get headaches from reading stuff on the computer , I wanted something I could throw in a bag and take anywhere , and it holds so many items that I do n\'t have to carry three or four novels with me in case I \'m bored or finish one . Nothing could prepare me for the actuality that is Kindle . It integrated seamlessly into my life . If I \'m at the desk , it \'s beside me ; if I \'m in the bedroom , it \'s on the nightstand ; I even take the silly thing to the john . It \'s so much easier than a book . I expected it to be a little awkward at first , but it really * does * get lost in your hands . Suddenly , you look down after a couple of hours of reading , and realize you \'ve been holding it all along and forgotten all about it . I expected to read novels and blogs on it . I never expected to be able to download all the .pdf technical manuals that I constantly have to weed through on the computer .

Note taking is my big thing . When I \'m looking at a book , I always find note-taking to be an instinct I have to avoid . I see it as a destructive process . I do n\'t want to ruin my books . Further , who can really concentrate on what they \'re reading with a pen in their hand ? It \'s two different mindsets . Yet , with Kindle , I do just that . I read a segment , I find a passage , I underline it . I have an opinion , I drop in a note . A question equals another note . When I do n\'t understand something , the dictionary is right at the bottom of the screen to define the word or teach me how to pronounce it ; or I can surf to the web and find exactly what I need .

I know a lot of people complain that it should have a bright screen so that you can read it at night , or that it should have color . I say - nay !

No having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes ; or ending a session of reading with a headache . No `` hot lap \'\' or mousing around to find the right page . It \'s just like a book .

96,28_2_R3QVVMUFRZN9Z9.txt,' Gamers who buy games developed or published by Atlus know that Atlus games tend to be somewhat different from other developers \' offerings . After several hours of play , I think it \'s fair to say that `` Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 \'\' continues this trend . The gameplay is fairly realistic , given that P3 is a Japanese RPG . In battle , they may stumble when attacking and leave themselves vulnerable to the enemies \' attacks . If you try to push them too hard , they will get tired , which will affect their performance . Ignore their fatigue , and they will get sick , which further hampers them . This principle applies to the main character , whom the player directly controls . Try to do everything , and you wo n\'t be able to do anything particularly well . Since part of the game involves the character \'s day-to-day life as a high school student , one can not expect major plot turns every day . However , the choices the player makes in school do have an effect on the player \'s options as a Persona user . The more connections the player forges with other students , the more power he will bring to bear as a Persona user , so expect consequences if you decide to play as a loner . Some players may find some of the imagery in this game disturbing , or even offensive . The characters summon their Personae by using a gun-like device called an Evoker . Unlike another reviewer , I do not think that they are mimicking suicide . Instead , given that in-game dialogue suggests that one can summon a Persona without an Evoker , I think that the Evoker is used to break down a character \'s inner barriers so that his Persona can manifest . While I understand why the summoning animations may be offensive to some , I do think that Atlus did it this way for a legitimate reason . However , parents thinking of getting this game for their teenage children should be aware that this game contains imagery that may be inappropriate . As for the title of this review , I think this might be a thinking man \'s RPG because of the themes I \'ve encountered thus far . I have n\'t completed the game yet , so I ca n\'t say I \'ve seen everything it has to offer . However , given the introductory movie that plays when you load the game , I think that Persona 3 will give an attentive player a few things to think about . For example , the player is asked to sign a contract at the beginning of the game . The terms seem simple enough , but when is responsibility ever simple ? As for technical details ; the graphics are somewhat minimalist , but very stylish . I think that the character and Persona portraits were well done , but I do n\'t think that Kazuma Kaneko ( who handled character design for the other SMT games on the PS2 ) was involved . Shoji Meguro , however , handled the soundtrack . I suspect that some of the hip-hop influenced tracks may begin to grate on me after further play , but I am a long-haired metalhead . Your mileage may vary . You may also dislike the voice acting , but the Config menu includes an option to turn off voiced dialogue for players who just want text .

103,276426_1_R38RBETCEFUYZL.txt,' This Nuvi does several things very well , and I \'ve yet to discover any serious shortcomings . My thoughts : Navigation : Excellent , as is typical with Garmin units . On a couple of occasions the voice ( right now I \'m using Australian Karen ) told me my destination was on the wrong side of the street . Map : The map is clear , the refresh rate is fast , and all of the right information is provided on-screen , including details for upcoming turns and junctions , speed limit , and traffic alerts . It \'s annoying that I ca n\'t choose to switch the display of my current speed to some other piece of info . I already have a speedometer . The 3D buildings feature seems pretty gimmicky , and is implemented sporadically , even in downtown Boston . When there is coverage , most buildings are monochromatic blocks , and not the photo-realistic buildings seen in screenshots . Lane Assist : This feature has been spot-on so far . It \'s nice driving in a new area and not getting flustered about being in the wrong lane . I have yet to see the full-screen 3D Lane Assist Junction View shown in the many 765t screenshots -- however , I \'ve done very little highway driving , and I believe this screen requires that the user press the top-left ( upcoming turn icon ) . > > > > > UPDATE : After some highway driving , it turns out that the full-screen 3D Lane Assist Junction View shows up automatically before potentially tricky highway junctions . Very nice . Traffic : As far as I know , I have not been re-routed because of traffic . However , it \'s very easy to bring up a list of major roads and their current traffic conditions , and to avoid them at will . The pop-up advertising associated with the `` free \'\' traffic is pretty subtle , and never distracting . Bluetooth : I \'m impressed with this feature so far . It mated with my phone ( old Motorola RAZR V3 ) easily , importing all of my contacts in the process . The ability to instantly dial any point of interest ( e.g. , to check on store hours ) is brilliant . The volume from the speaker is reasonably loud . I also tried sending the audio to my car stereo using an audio cable , and the output seemed a bit low ( I had to turn my car stereo way up ) . I have not yet tried sending the audio to my car stereo using the FM transmitter . I called my voicemail , and the built-in microphone picks up my voice reasonably well with the engine running . I \'m not sure how well it would work with highway speeds . I \'m told that the cheap Garmin microphone ( which plugs into the cradle , not the unit ) improves voice quality . > > > > > UPDATE : This is true -- the microphone is an improvement , though it adds yet another long cord to your long cord collection . Also , I \'ve tried the FM transmitter . It works , albeit with a certain amount of static . I imagine this feature would intolerable if you are driving a long way . Other features : I have n\'t used the SD card slot for anything . I have n\'t tried the photo viewer or the mp3 player , and I probably wo n\'t . Build Quality : Seems solid . The unit has a certain heft to it , and it \'s covered in a soft , rubbery coating . I \'ve also dropped it already ( because I \'m an idiot ) -- still working beautifully . Suggested improvements : Garmin does n\'t make it easy to look up the actual coordinates ( latitude and longitude ) for favorites or points of interest . This information should be available at the press of a button . Needless to say , I \'m pleased with my purchase . The 756t is not cheap right now , and if you can live without the new features , you might be better off with an older unit . That said , if you \'re looking for a gps device with all of the latest features and compatibility , this seems to be a solid pick . ',normal

107,47_8_R2Q3ZC5KWIH5LC.txt,' Bill O\'Reilly joins the ranks of people like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity with `` Culture Warrior \'\' in producing a work that huffs and puffs over an America that might only exist in their own minds and the minds of their devoted fans . So let \'s take `` Culture Warrior \'\' seriously for a moment and give O\'Reilly the benefit of the doubt : America is currently engaged in a cultrural `` war \'\' between conservatives and liberals for the soul of America and the battleground is largely the media ( of which O\'Reilly is a part of ) and anything else considered `` popular culture . \'\' O\'Reilly uses various examples including the opinions of Hollywood figures such as Susan Sarandon , Jay Leno and his favorite , David Letterman . Apparently O\'Reilly believes these guys in conjunction with rap music , are a national threat . Like Pat Buchanan \'s `` State Of Emergency , \'\' `` Culture Warrior \'\' feels more like the worries and observations of someone who is watching history pass by and would like to turn the clock back . O\'Reilly caters to the fears and worries of the conservative right by assuring them that we \'re the `` good guys \'\' and that Iraq is a just war ( of course Mr. O\'Reilly has never served a day in combat or actually participated in an armed conflict ) . `` Culture Warrior \'\' is a surprisingly short book , composed of much material from `` The O\'Reilly Factor \'\' TV show , so it \'s not a very serious study to begin with , not because of the length , but because of the detail and quality of the content . At times O\'Reilly comes across as one of those old-fashioned preachers who see Satan everywhere and must cast him out of your living room and television set . He taps into typical conservative slogans by using terms like `` we need to be warriors , \'\' `` you got ta fight back , \'\' `` Islamofascism . \'\' He rants and raves about the key points to outdo your `` opponent \'\' when debating a `` Secular Progressive . \'\' Like Buchanan , O\'Reilly is shouting for an America that is quickly fading into the past , if it has not already faded . I would think a `` Culture Warrior \'\' would realize that cultures change , evolve , for better or worse , nothing stays the same forever . Like Ann Coulter , much of O\'Reilly \'s prose here caters more to the elites in America , with disturbing undertones in the descriptions of `` lower class \'\' America . Is Bill O\'Reilly really the most qualified voice to critique the merits of Hip Hop music ? And have n\'t we had this same old tired argument since the days of Elvis ? `` Culture Warrior \'\' is a requiem , a requiem bathed in self-dillusion about a `` culture \'\' that probably never existed to begin with . `` Culture Warrior \'\' will most likely fade with time as well , and in the future I imagine students will be reading Noam Chomsky to a higher degree than they ever will read Bill O\'Reilly .

1233,13_18_R1OONW53NLUMHD.txt,' How would I describe the plot in Dead in the Family ? Oh , right , there is no plot ! All you \'ll get is a series of choppy , unpolished storylines mixed with brief appearances from the large number of characters in this book .

114,27_3_R32D6SSBZJU2ZO.txt,' Ok , so this is a cop movie , 2 cops , serious white guy ( Bruce Willis ) and stereotypical bumbling black guy . So lets consider the primary aspects of the movie : 1 ) Story line : An extremely weak plot . A snitch tells 2 bumbling cops about a narcotics drop off . The cops have a stake out ( with just 2 guys ) , it goes foul , snitch dies . In comes a drug baron , a very very cheesy mexican dude with equally cheesy Mexican actors as side kicks . I live in LA , and I know mexican tough guys , these guys are the kinder garden variety . Seems the drug baron has lost a car . White guy ( Bruce ) has daughter \'s wedding , needs 50g \'s , decides to sell a rare baseball card . Card gets stolen by Stifler ( from American pie ... of Stifler \'s Mom fame ) . Stifler is in to parcour ( Street jumping ) and steals the baseball card , which he sells to the drug lord . Then comes the worst ever street jumping clip ever filmed . I mean if I had a retarded little brother , who had polio ... probably he could jump better . Drug lord strikes a deal with the cops , get the car ... get the baseball card back . Hmmm .. didnt know any NY cops who were soft enough to let a street hood call the shots . Anyway , these 2 evidently allow it . They trace the car .. By interrogating a 11 year old car jacker ! JESUS ! Car has been sold to a russian attorney . Honestly ... NY lawyers make enough money to buy new cars ( especially if living in a mansion with a swimming pool and detached garage as shown here ) , and any lawyer knows better than to deal in stolen goods and have his license revoked . /facepalm ! The cops get the car , and surprisingly , there is a girl in the trunk , thumping away . Evidently she has been there 2 days . And no one noticed it , with all the dealings with the car ... while stealing the car , changing the number plates ( as you would expect car thieves to do ) or while the car was being sold to the lawyer . Well , the cops find the girl . She is the ex-mistress of a Mexican drug baron , who our NY drug baron killed . She has a flash drive with the mexican baron \'s bank information . Passwords and cash amounts . ( How convinient ) . She gives the 2 cops the slip , and leaves the flash drive ( her only bargaining chip ) behind . She is eventually caught by the NY drug baron . Insane twist : Stifler is being held for felony robbery , assault with a deadly weapon , Assault on a police officer . I believe that the bail for that would be around a couple of million dollars , but ... guess what ... Bruce willis , who doesnt have 50 g \'s for his kid \'s wedding , has dough enough to bail him . BIG hole in the plot ! Plan : stifler is going to go in to the NY drug baron \'s house ( which everyone seems to know where it is ... ) and its a condemned house ( by the looks of it ) . Stifler falls off the roof and dies ( Lol ) . the cops are in a shoot out . The bad guys die . Black dude finds out from nanny cam his wife isnt cheating on him . Bruce \'s wife \'s 2nd husband pays for the wedding . The flash drive is forgotten . You are left with a wtf feeling . Take `` Shutter Island \'\' for example . It had one story to tell , which it did solidly . Genius , Scorsese style . Take `` Cop Out \'\' , mindless plot made up by a writer who is obviously on some serious drugs . There is NOTHING which ties up . The story line is absolutely nonsense . There is some lame attempts at slapstick humor , but it is horribly presented . Acting : Bruce willis is a respected actor . He must have been seriously compromised ( wine or women ? ) to take up this pathetic role . His team up with the black dude is really really ill matched . There is absolutely no on screen chemistry . There is a scene , where the black guy literally pouts and says `` PUH LEEEEAAASSE ... look at the nanny cam I put in my wife \'s bedroom to find out if she is cheating on me . I am too gutless to look , please look and tell me what happens . \'\' How lame is that .... The acting makes you disrespect Bruce Willis . Everyone else is pretty bad as well .

About a half-hour ago this Crucial 2GB 667 Mhz CT25664AC667 DDR2 200-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory card arrived in the mail . I opened up and removed the small plastic cover on the bottom of my computer , released the clips holding the original supplied 1 GB memory card in place ( when you release the clips , the card pops up for easy removal ) , replaced the original card with this one , replaced the cover , inserted the battery , and turned on the computer . This new memory card was instantly recognized . I did NOT have to press the F2 or F10 key . I do not know why some others had to do this ( and I do not doubt their experiences ) but , immediately after I installed the card and turned on the computer in the normal fashion , I checked the memory available - and there was my 2 GB of RAM showing . The entire mechanical installation process is quite simple and straightforward . The only tool necessary is a small Phillips-head screwdriver ( mine came in a screwdriver set from Dollar Tree ! ) to remove the screws . Please note that , for the Asus Eee PC 1000 line , there are several YouTube videos which show in detail the whole process which takes no more than two or three minutes . The hardest part ? Carefully removing the plastic cover on the back of the computer . The screws remove easily but there are several internal plastic clips on the sides of the cover ( not visible ) which must be released gently so as not to break them ( they do seem robust , however ) . Once the cover is removed , actually removing and replacing the memory is simple . I have used Crucial memory cards in other laptop computers over the years and I have always found them to be completely reliable .

132,24_6_RDRZLE5RKXR0D.txt,' Most people born and raised in America can not even imagine the depths of poverty that most of the rest of the world are forced to live with . This story illuminates this fact , as we enter the world of Kino , a pearl diver and occasional fisherman , his wife Juana , and their baby son , Coyotito . All they have is a grass shack house , a few clay cooking utensils , and their prize possession , Kino \'s boat , inherited from his father and grandfather . The boat is the family \'s livelihood , providing the means to put a meal on the table and to provide a few pesos for store bought goods by selling the small pearls Kino is able to find . But Kino and his family , far from being depressed or unhappy , have a great treasure , the love they have for each other and their satisfaction with life as it is , with few disturbing dreams of greater things . But their quiet , routine life is turned upside down the day that Kino finds a Great Pearl . Suddenly Kino can dream of better things : a rifle for himself , school for his son so he will be able to read and tell what is really in the books , a real house . But dreams can be deadly things . Dreams lead to desire , and desire to greed , and greed to violence . What happens to Kino and family from this point on is not a pretty story . Now we see that underneath the quiet , idyllic seeming small town and its inhabitants lie the seeds of cheating , betrayal , collusion , fear , and murder . And we see the gradual loss of Kino \'s real treasures . By the end of the book , events have reached the level of real tragedy , and you , along with Kino , are liable to end up in a state of emotional exhaustion . Steinbeck \'s prose for this book matches his characters and situation very well , a very minimalist sentence structure and set of speech patterns . As a parable , the story has a strong moralistic point , but Steinbeck does not overdrive his thematic message , but lets his story speak for itself . One of Steinbeck \'s great strengths was his ability to capture on paper the characters he saw around him , and this book is a showcase for that talent . The characters of Kino and Juana are exquisitely drawn , real people you can relate to even though their lifestyles may be very far from your own . And because they are real people , it is very hard not to get drawn into their lives , where their dreams and their pains very readily become your own . This may not be Steinbeck \'s greatest book , as it is too short and with too limited a focus to compare to something like his Grapes of Wrath .

Even horrible books fulfill this , if they manage to get me to turn the pages . In a way , Cocktails for Three managed this feat as well , as I was turning each page waiting for one of the three women to exhibit some form of development . Nada . It was really a disaster of a book in this case . Over 300 pages , it is nice to see a character grow . Instead , everything wrapped up and we were really no different off than we were on page one . Let \'s start with Roxanne . She was agonizing over how much longer she wanted to be `` the other woman \'\' in her long time affair with a married man . In the end , it was over because he was dying and wanted to live out his days with his wife . Not because Roxanne got some self esteem and realized that she deserved more . Not because she got any moral pangs about what she was doing . It just ended in the most contrived way possible . What did Roxanne learn from the situation ? Instead , she \'s going to be mourning for the lover that she thought was dumping her , but was really just dying instead . I feel bad for the next in line of her relationships , because she \'s going to have a load of issues . Luckily , for you men out there , she \'s fictional . Candice . I just did n\'t get her . The whole plot with her getting taken advantage of and screwed over by a girl seeking revenge was actually one of the better parts of this book . You knew the girl was up to something right away , but it was fun watching it play out . What I really hated about Candice were the constant anti-capitalism/consumer remarks she made throughout the whole book . Things along the line of whining to her neighbor that he should n\'t be taking a paid leave of absence from work when there are people unemployed , or that he should sell his house out in the country because some people are homeless . Where was that attitude when she was hanging out with her friend Maggie , who had a 20 acre estate ? Or when the girls were out at the very posh Manhattan Bar , ordering drinks that probably were 8 quid a piece or something outrageous ? And finally , if the author wanted us to believe that Candice had this selfless attitude where she wanted to help everyone , having her fall for neighbor AFTER she found out he drove an expensive car and was wealthy is n\'t a way to reinforce her supposed lack of materialism . It \'s almost as if some of these things were thrown in as an afterthought . And finally , there is Maggie . As a career woman , I can understand the lack of desire to be a stay-at-home mom . However , I do n\'t think I can emphazize with the character . Maybe , if we were just once shown that Maggie had any feelings of love towards her own child , I could relate . But all of her struggles were her own doing because she was afraid of perception . She was n\'t ever worried that she was n\'t doing enough for her daughter , but rather that people would think she was n\'t such a superwoman afterall . Yes , Maggie . You probably are better off in the office . I disliked the way she just announced to her husband that they were moving back to London . Great communication there , hun . After moaning about how you never agreed with the choice in the first place , maybe you would have treated your husband with the respect you wish you had been treated with . Nope . Instead she does him just like he did her . There really was no maturity with this woman . And I want to pretend that I did n\'t read the page where she was really judgemental of the other neighborhood mom , calling her a `` stepford mum \'\' . It \'s so obnoxious when women in powerful positions have no other way to enjoy that power than by letting the world know that she is better than another woman who did not choose her path . OK , so I \'m a little bit annoyed by a Sunday afternoon beach read . But for my $ 11 and 300 pages , I do expect just a little bit of actual writing ability . I will not be sampling any of the shopoholic series . ',ironisch

140,23_13_R29EKQDD1KCLTU.txt,' I am a conservative economist who , like many of the reviewers here , never voted for Bill Clinton . However , unlike those same reviewers , I read this entire book . I must say that it is somewhat satisfying to understand the thought processes behind this president . He is a remarkably bright individual who overcame a somewhat deprived childhood to excel at some of the world \'s finest educational institutions . Given the ineptitude of the current administration which won on pedigree , it is refreshing to know that hard work , intellect , and perseverance can also lead to the White House . The book has a few tedious moments . The Arkansas campaigns are littered with the names of individuals no one outside of the Ozarks will recognize . On the whole though , this book delivers for the aficionado of American politics . You will see the deep thought and debate surrounding policy decisions . You will appreciate the fact that this president actually led his administration with his own ideas and strategies for implementing them . Likewise , he wrote many of his own speeches and routinely held press conferences without knowing the questions in advance . I would have liked even more from these areas , but the book does provide as much depth as most political memoirs . What I would like from Clinton \'s second book would be a discussion of the perception and reality of American politics . For example , the Bush administration , with annual budget and trade deficits of over $ 1 trillion , has the most liberal fiscal policy since the Johnson administration . At the same time , they have increased the size of the government more than any other administration in history , with the effects of the war and 9/11 accounting for only 45 \% of this enormous growth . Clinton , on the other hand , was extremely conservative during his second term , shrinking the government , slowing the growth in expenditures across the board , and balancing the budget . Yet , Clinton is reviled as being too liberal by conservatives who do n\'t seem to do their homework . It \'s too bad they \'re unwilling to spend time reading a book like this instead of allowing radio talk show hosts to fill their heads with lies that matter . ',normal

I therefore came to this book with high expectations , and they were not disappointed . Mr. Norman has a way with his stories of telling them in a calm and sure voice that reassures the reader while at the same time advancing the plot effortlessly . This plot involves a protagonist whose parents both commit suicide on the same day , by jumping from different bridges . He \'s then taken in by an Aunt and Uncle who have a daughter about his age . The uncle has a sled and toboggan making business , and our young man joins him in this . It is 1941 and , in Nova Scotia , the threat of ship sinking by German subs is never very far from everyone \'s thoughts.In fact , the uncle has become obsessed with it , and papers the wall of his workshop with newspaper clippins and pictures about subs and sinkings . The plot really takes off when the daughter brings home a young German student whose family fled to Denmark to escape the Nazis . Despite this , he is looked upon as a potential enemy by almost everyone in the small town where the action takes place . His arrival sets off a chain of events that is both tragic and heartfelt . To say more would be to ruin the book for potential readers .

149,51_13_RO8R2WG3YKOTG.txt,' Certain words from various sources have been quoted , describing Justin Cronin \'s The Passage as `` gripping \'\' , `` intense \'\' and `` epic \'\' . I guess The Passage is considered to be an epic , because it clocks in at close to 800 pages . But by the time I finished reading , I felt this was an epic fail of massive proportions , and unless another book comes along this year , The Passage will be my most disappointing and worst read book . The hype is not always correct , even when a well-known respected author supports a book in such a way where you must have it as soon as you can . The Passage begins in the not so distant future , around the year 2014 . The first paragraph is somewhat poetic and confusing , where you have to read it a few times to digest it ; much like the majority of this book : `` Before she became the Girl from Nowhere- the One Who Walked In , the first and Last and Only , who lives a thousand years- she was just a little girl in Iowa , named Amy . \'\' Amy \'s mother , Jeanette , gave birth to Amy when she was only nineteen , impregnated by a married traveling salesman . Jeanette ends up becoming a prostitute . One night her latest John wo n\'t take no for an answer , and she kills him . Jeanette has no choice but to give up her six-year-old daughter and leaves Amy at a covenant . The nun who takes in Amy is a young black woman , Sister Lacey , who believes God sent Amy to her for a reason . Lacey has been having disturbing dreams . But this is nothing new since Lacey has been a little girl , she has always known , understood , because THE VOICE speaks to her . Lacey knows Amy will bring forth a new way of life on Earth . How does she know this ? Because it \'s stated without any real reason given . Around the same time Amy is abandoned by her mother and thought of the second coming of who knows what by Sister Lacey , Special Agent Brad Wolgast and his partner have criss-crossed all over the Unites States to pick up a select group of inmates to be experimented on by the government . This has come about because Harvard professor , Jonas Lear , has gone into the wilds of the Bolivian jungle along with a group of scientist and grad students on behalf of the USMRIID ( United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ) . Less than a month in , Lear has grave news . Through emails with one of his Harvard associates , he tells about an attack by bloodthirsty bats , causing death and sickness in his group . He and the victims are eventually rescued by the US military . Wolgast figures out pretty quickly why twelve special inmates have been chosen . They are being infected purposely with the bat virus founded by Lear . But when Wolgast \'s boss orders him to pick up Amy for testing , that is when Wolgast knows something more sinister is at play . For some reason Amy is the key to this all . Again , no reason is given and should only be taken at face value . Wolgast will put his life in danger to save Amy . But by then it \'s too late . Wolgast and Amy are able to escape , but those twelve inmates have transformed into `` virals \'\' , bloodthirsty , hiding in trees , almost zombie like creatures who crave blood . And from some mind hypnosis and hallucinations through dreams , they can control humans and are able to make their way out into the world . Wolgast and Amy hide in the mountains . From very limited newspaper reports , he reads about the downfall of civilization and how the virals are infecting and multiplying . Amy has changed . She can no longer stand sunlight and does n\'t seem to age , but has n\'t crossed over as a viral for some reason . Again , no explanation why . There is one last resort by the US government to stop the viral apocalypse . An atomic bomb is dropped . Ninety-two years after the virals have wreaked havoc on the Unites States , ( there \'s no knowledge of how the other European countries have faired because all communication has ceased ) the remaining humans , who were mainly children rounded up by the US military , have carved a life out for themselves . These closed off communities in the mid central United States have found a way to carry on . The virals only come out at night and attack , so the humans armed with their bow and arrows , and protective high protective fences , keep these creatures at bay . There is a select colony mentioned in the San Jacinto Mountains near California to show this perfectly . But lately everyone is on edge . Their source of electricity is running out and the virals are evolving . And then a young girl comes out of nowhere who some have dreamt of . She is Amy , the ageless , and the only one who can destroy the virals . The people of the First Colony must travel back to where it all began and bring Amy to the one who calls for her . The first section of The Passage will grab hold and not let up . Cronin sets into motion a tension filled tale that you assume will have you shaking in fear . Unfortunately , due to very long winded paragraphs and so much information being handed out , without any explanation , The Passage is more of a mind numbing vision quest with heavy , almost in your face religious and spiritual mentions . I was so bogged down with so much telling and not enough showing . The majority of the time I was very confused . Cronin does n\'t give any plausible reasons , and we are just supposed to take it as fact and move on . Most of the characters appear , where we are privy to their backgrounds , much like a biography , and then they disappear , only to re-appear again and bring nothing more to the story . This happens way too often . I could n\'t connect with anyone , not even Amy . I felt very much like an outsider as I read . The virals , that should be scary boogieman type creatures , were glazed over in such a way that when they barely come out from the shadows they are hiding in to cause shock and horror , were incredibly tame and dull if anything . The overuse of the two words , `` I am \'\' became beyond tedious . Talk about a mantra that will give you a headache . Perhaps the title should have been I Am instead of The Passage ? Amy can hear the virals \' thoughts , as I am John , Dick , Harry ... I am the former Walrus , goo goo ga joob . I was n\'t gripped , amazed or enthralled in any way . I felt like I was reading one of those literary journals I used for research back in college . 300 pages could have been eliminated easily to make it a much tighter read . In essence , the idea of a new spin on a vampire apocalypse sounds perfect , but the way Cronin wrote it , he has missed the mark big time . The Passage will no doubt become a best seller and will prove that a very lacking book can become an overnight sensation based on amazing hype , the support of much respected industry types , and an expensive marketing and promotion plan from the publisher .

155,9_11_R37TTG3TZTW0BZ.txt,' So many of the reviews are more about the character \'s actions- I \'d prefer to actually discuss the book . My sister just started high school , she \'s 15 and she lent New Moon and the first book , Twilight to me . Despite our age gap ( I \'m sixteen years older ) I found them a very engaging and entertaining read . I \'m glad to share these with her and I \'d suggest them to anyone who is staring at a younger , somewhat mysterious female relative wondering what to buy them for Christmas . The pacing is good . The book is a quick , satisfying read . My feeling is that the author works through scenes rather than writing in a linear fashion- and the scenes are fairly cinematic in their structure which I personally like . She gets to the point in her stories and fits a lot of action and significant detail in without overwhelming you with a density of vision . If you \'re concerned about the content , as in `` Is this appropriate to give my neice/cousin \'s kid etc \'\' you can be assured that the romantic tension captured here is through restraint rather than exploration . Not too surprizingly this is highly seductive . Several reviews seem disappointed by the character \'s actions and have given fewer stars . However , I \'d like to say that this book is clearly part of a larger work and we \'re seeing Bella at a certain point in her personal growth . It is not a conclusion novel so it does n\'t feel like one . She acts like , well , a confused person in love . I think the depiction is honest and it is a good thing when a character can annoy or drive you crazy : it means you \'re engaged and the author has done their job well . I \'ll be honest- I was n\'t expecting to be drawn in , now I \'m a bit annoyed I have to wait until next fall . New Moon is the sequel to Twilight , so I \'m covering both in my review .

157,6_15_R31Q51ZUICUGFT.txt,' Sam Wasson \'s just-released and delightful book on the making of `` Breakfast at Tiffany \'s \'\' is so chock-full of great anecdotes that you \'re sorry when it \'s over . For awhile , you are there - a privileged insider-witness to a marvelous bygone moment in moviemaking history - and it \'s with a feeling of bittersweet regret that you step from its closing pages back into a realm of noisy 3D sequels and superfluous comic book franchises . Everything you \'d want to know and more is delivered in the book , from the reader \'s coverage producer Marty Jurow was first handed , re : adapting Capote \'s book for the screen ( `` In any event this is more of a character sketch than a story . NOT RECOMMENDED \'\' ) to the guest list for the post-premiere party ( including such unlikely elbow-rubbers as Dennis Hopper , Buster Keaton , Charles Laughton , and Jane Mansfield ) . A delicious through-line in the book is how close the movie came to not coming out so well as it did , with such jaw-droppers as everyone \'s resistance to having Henry Mancini write a song for the thing ( eventual collaborator Johnny Mercer \'s original lyric , we learn , one of three eventually presented to Mancini , was called `` Blue River \'\' ) . An intimate exploration of the myriad personalities in conflict and collusion when a casual classic is being created , the book is cannily adept at detailing the logic of the so many minute decisions that lead to what we now accept as inevitable . Of course Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly , you think , until you hear how hard Capote lobbied for Marilyn Monroe . Wasson is a formidable researcher . He does n\'t so much know where the bodies are buried as he knows where the hearts and minds are hidden . The book is written like a good novel , taking you inside the consciousness of its characters with an impressive , insight-laden believability ( `` Fifth Avenue \'\' \'s only recent movie-book rival in this regard is Mark Harris \' fascinating `` Pictures at a Revolution \'\' ) . And Wasson \'s notes on how he arrived at , and can justify , his leaps of imagination and empathy are almost as interesting as the text itself . Of course the book has its thesis and theories as well , positing `` Breakfast at Tiffany \'s \'\' and Hepburn \'s stylish , fresh , era-defining performance as a watershed moment in cultural history . If you \'re a fan of Audrey Hepburn , the book is a must-have , because Wasson \'s astute take on what she was about , what she was up against , and how she delivered the goods strikes me as definitive . Her spritely , near-angelic spirit comes alive in the pages of this eminently devour-able book , which is kind of an awesome dividend . ',normal
158,9_5_R3JQNBITXXN2D.txt,' The Scent of Rain and Lightning by Nancy Pickard was the best novel I \'ve read in a long time . The first couple of pages grabbed me -- there was no reading half the book before I decided I liked it . Pickard writes in an easy style about people and life in Kansas , but it could be any rural/ranching setting . The characters were described so perfectly that I felt like I grew up with them . This is a murder mystery , but it \'s definitely not your typical who-done-it . The plot unfolds gently -- no harsh , sharp twists and turns . It \'s also a love story and a story of a close-knit family . It has everything but nothing is contrived ; it \'s all very natural and believable . I think the best way to describe the book is that it \'s a gentle , easy story about some ungentle events . I can understand why Pickard has received so many awards . She is a great American author ; in my opinion on the same level as Twain and Steinbeck . This book is a MUST READ . ',normal

160,23_3_R3BAK7LUCD9IDR.txt,' I had read and enjoyed Haruki Murakami \'s tetralogy ( Hear the Wind Sing , Pinball , A Wild Sheep Chase , and Dance Dance Dance ) , and I loved his Wind-Up Bird Chronicle novel , but I was ready for something new . In reviews and on websites , I had read over and over about Norwegian Wood , the & quot ; straightforward & quot ; novel that was published years ago in Japan , which still was not for sale in the states , since there was not an authorized translation available . This novel sold a HUGE number of copies in Japan . I was wondering : I love those other novels by Murakami . Are they so demanding ? Complicated ? If Norwegian Wood is so much simpler than the other novels , will I even like Norwegian Wood ? The plot : It \'s the late 1960 \'s . College student Toru falls in love with the girlfriend of his ( dead ) best friend . She eventually becomes ill ( though not physically ill ) and has to leave to live under special circumstances , far away from him . While she \'s gone , he meets Midori , a college student who obviously is interested in him . But he \'s holding out for his girlfriend Naoko . Never knowing if she will recover from her ailment and be able to rejoin him in society , he goes to classes , sells phonograph records at night , and spends some time with Midori . He visits Naoko a few times , gets to know her wacky roommate/friend/mentor Reiki , and eventually he has to decide between a life with Naoko ( without Naoko ? ) or with Midori . Throw in a bizarre Geography-major roommate nicknamed & quot ; Storm Trooper , & quot ; a scene where Midori ( badly ) sings folk songs to our Toru while they watch a neighborhood fire from the balcony above her parents \' bookshop , and assorted other hilarious/bizarre characters and passages , and you \'ve got vintage Haruki Murakami . My favorite scene is one in which Midori takes Toru to visit her ill father in the hospital . He \'s so ill he can barely eat or speak , but Toru convinces Midori to enjoy a respite , and take a walk by herself out to a park in town . Toru is left alone with this bedridden stranger , in a situation that would seem forced , harsh , and impossible to enjoy , yet they make some very odd and touching inroads with each other . It \'s very unusual , and perfect in just the way that so many of Murakami \'s scenes seem to be . The novel is n\'t as complex as Haruki \'s other work , and it \'s missing some of the magical realist / sci-fi / unexplainable elements that were so prevalent in Dance Dance Dance , Wild Sheep Chase , and Wind-Up Bird Chronicle . However , this novel is just as enjoyable , and just as worthwhile . This novel has a sustained emotional depth that other works by Murakami only achieve in passages . If you \'re a fan of modern literature at all , do yourself a favor . Read Norwegian Wood , and read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle . ken32 ',normal

It started out merely predictable , but quickly became unbelievable , and eventually escalated into eye-popping nonsense . If you enjoy this , you should stick with TV movies .

189,19_7_R23RNU0Q60V7MT.txt,' While from a purely academic standpoint this book is informative , interesting , and overall excellently written , it has a far greater purpose than simply to satisfy idle curiosity . Monkeys and apes exist as one of the greatest threats to mankind . I submit as evidence the multiple cases of chimps just flipping out and going bananas on their owners , often biting off noses , fingers , and testes , or even killing their comparatively helpless victims . A 90 pound chimp is more than a match for most fully grown men . Capuchins , while seemingly innocuous due to their diminutive stature and `` cute \'\' appearance , are possibly the worst of the bunch . Disturbingly self-aware , capuchins ( as described in this book ) are probably the most intelligent of the new world monkeys , possessing exceptionally large brains for their body size ( second only to humans ) . In addition , Michelle Press does an excellent job of describing some of the more frightening actions of these simian killing machines , including forming totem poles of up to four monkeys piled on top of each other as they converge on their doomed prey . I encourage anyone at all concerned about the growing threat of capuchin dominance to read this book in order to stem the tide of the marmoset menace . The next person they go ape on could be you .

206,35_16_R3MK5GP7F1QVX8.txt,' Many people will look at this film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber \'s classic musical spectacular , THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with mixed emotions . There are people who will be upset that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford , who played the original Christine and Phantom respectively , were not allowed to recreate their signature roles . There will also be people who \'ll be disappointed that this version is not a literal translation of the stage musical . Finally , we have the critics of both Webber and director Joel Schumacher , who have both been accused of wretched excess in previous projects in their individual careers . Taken as a film version however , this PHANTOM stands the test of time , not only as a wonderful musical film , but as one of the more faithful versions of Gaston Laroux \'s romance/horror novel . Starting with a black and white prologue , the film tells the story of budding opera star Christine Daae and the two men who fight for her heart : the noble Viscount who she knew in childhood , and the mysterious Phantom of the Paris Opera House who hides his ugliness behind a half-mask while sponsoring Christine \'s career . Like the stage production , this film is awash in glorious colors and sets that would put many epics to shame . It \'s well balanced by solid performances that help propel the romantic , if melodramatic , story along . Gerard Butler makes for a wonderfully dark and obsessive Phantom , while allowing the character to retain the audience \'s sympathy . Miranda Richardson is solid as the dour Madame Giry , who knows the Phantom \'s secret . Minnie Driver easily gets the most laughs as the over-bearing diva , Carlotta . ( It \'s interesting to note that Ms. Driver \'s singing is dubbed in the film proper , while she actually sings the new closing credits melody `` Learn to be Lonely . \'\' ) Patrick Wilson makes for a stalwart , if somewhat bland , Viscount . But the strongest impression is made by the lovely Emmy Rossum . Only in her late teens when filming , she turns in a fantastic performance with a crystal clear voice that does justice to Webber \'s score . Joel Schumacher does a strong enough job in directing this film , allowing the music and the screenplay that he co-wrote with Webber to shine . In the end , THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delightful spectacle that does justice in its own way to both the stage original and Laroux \'s book . As such , this is a film I highly recommend .

It hurts the conservatives to have someone like this on their side . This book should have been called `` Who Needs Facts ? \'\' There is n\'t a single fact in this book . I repeat , NOT ONE SINGLE FACT . Coming up with moderately clever ways of stretching any viewpoint other than her own into an artless caricature of itself , then smugly and ruthlessly slamming everyone who holds that viewpoint , is much more fun ( and more satisfying ) than doing research . Coulter does n\'t need facts . After all , if anyone asks her why liberals are evil , she can just tell them it \'s because God said so . Let me assert that I am not a liberal only here to take potshots at a well-known conservative . I am in the middle of the political road . My view is that both extremes are usually wrong . As an example , one of the guys in my workplace is the stereotypical angry young liberal : loud , opinionated , arrogant , abrasive , and ready to lay every problem in the civilized world at the feet of our current conservative President , GW Bush . Obviously , there are things wrong out there that have nothing to do with President Bush , but you just ca n\'t tell this guy that .

I have current time , Arrival Time , and Distance showing on mine ... it is customizable though and you can choose what you want to display ... including Direction of Travel and Elevation . It is a true Groovy Nuvi in that Garmin makes the best GPS units on the market ( My opinion ) and this one allows you to have your cake and eat it too . Not to mention the icing is great .

223,4_12_R33HMUU129WA4T.txt,' Timeless works often suffer at the hands of translators . One thinks of the numerous and continuing attempts to render Dante \'s `` Divina Commedia \'\' ( another early vernacular Italian masterpiece and contemporary to the justifiably obscure Tuscana Latte series ) and the struggle with both terza rima and meaning . No so for Tuscan Whole Milk ( `` La tutta latte \'\' ) . Few works are better left where they were found , their authors condemned and eventually flogged . This translation of the redredged third valume of the series was committed by Sir John Stilton , the inebriated English librettist for two of the earliest publicly-immolated operas by P.D.Q Bach , themselves loosely based , in part , on the Tuscan series and `` Mechanicae Popularum \'\' : `` Die Fliegende Kuhe \'\' and `` Das Zaubereuter \'\' , both banned before their opening nights sometime in the early 1760s . That Stilton translated the Tuscan series at all was no mere stroke of misfortune . He was a cousin of Leopold von Emmenthaler , present at the Great Flushing of the Florentine sewers in 1755 . As recounted in his memoir `` Besottene Reisen \'\' , returning to his rooms late one night from a drinking binge , Leopold fell into an open ditch which drained into the Arno , but had been clogged . He was saved from drowning in the filth by the floating obstruction created by a massive snarl of wig hair and old used manuscripts -- part of which would later be tragically identified as the only complete copy of `` Tuscan . \'\' Inspired to further drink by the experience , Leopold vowed to champion the mysterious work . He passed it to Stilton in a stupor sometime in 1759 . Though arrested , Leopold was never proscuted for the act and he fled to his native Limburg . Rarely misunderstood and best left un-retold , `` Whole Milk \'\' is the culminating volume of the Tuscan series , but can be read ( if necessary ) as a standalone work , as both Skim ( `` Scremato \'\' or `` Senza Grassi \'\' ) and Two-Percent ( `` Cauto \'\' ) are diatribes on celibacy and vegetables respectively . A tale of love , betrayal , and gastrointestinal distress , it is in this infamous portion of the `` work \'\' that Contessa Bessi meets the cowherd Giovanni de Sargento ( the cloaked `` Count Grasso \'\' ) and confronts him with the immortal question `` Got ta de latte ? \'\' This dubiuosly romantic passage is considered by some scholars as the inspiration for later poetry ( e.g . Wordsworth \'s `` I Wandered Lonely as a Cow \'\' ( 1804 ) ; Dickinson \'s `` # 255 \'\' , ( `` \'\' Cow \'\' is the thing with horns . \'\' ( 1867 ) ) , books ( `` Care of Dairy Cattle in Central Peru \'\' ( 1843 ) ; Proust \'s `` Du Cafe chez Vache \'\' ( 1914 ) ) , and even movies ( among them `` Cud \'\' ( 1963 ) with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal ; `` El Cud , \'\' ( 1961 ) with Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren ; and `` The Guns of Navorone \'\' ( 1961 ) with Gregorgy Peck and Anthony Quinn ) . This Stilton translation of Tuscan Whole Milk remains one of the more curdling , if only because he manages to improve the flavor of the work to the point that more innocent readers might be unwittingly exposed to it . It is clear that Stilton spoke little Italian , certainly not the 14th century vernacular of the region , and had no concept of style and structure . It is not certain that he was even completely literate in English . One star for calcium . ',ironisch
1197,15_1_R2XQID2NCROIIL.txt,' Judging from the reviews here and the vast difference between the people that enjoyed the book and the people that hated the book you can tell that the author hit a nerve . Although some reviews here argue that the book is just more of the same old Liberal Media ; if you read the book you will find a very well-written and thought out documentation of the state of the current `` media \'\' and that they have moved past center and into the land of the conservative right . The book is very good with just a bit of nastiness thrown at the far right conservatives that have attacked he author in the past ( and after this book has come out thouse attacked have increased ) . To be honest I was concerned the book would be a bit dull given that I had seen a few interviews the author gave and he did not come across on TV as a very engaging person . Well his writing style is the polar opposite of his `` on air \'\' personality . He is quick witted and sharp . I just did not find anything objectionable about the book . What I did find is enough ammunition to argue any case of liberal bias in the media with anyone . How , after reading the book , you would not come to the same understanding as the author I do not know . You would have to be so set in your current mindset that no amount of proof and well-constructed argument would change your mind . Then again people still swear Elvis is alive . Overall the book was great and a must read if you are interested in the media or liberal politics . It is all the proof you need that the `` Liberal Media \'\' is a long incorrect statement that gives the far right another name calling opportunity . ',normal

227,276423_5_RVX9KXA2FZEM5.txt,' I am writing this review , because every review on here seems to be about the author and his biases and not about the BOOK itself . Let me first say that I am an avid reader . I read everything from Stephenie Meyer to Bertrand Russell , Chuck Palahniuk to Freakonomics . I read 3-5 books per week , fiction and non-fiction alike . I knew very little about Glenn Beck before I purchased this book . Of course I had heard his name , and that he was a radio personality , but that \'s about it . I read a little about him before beginning the book , learning that he is a `` conservative libertarian . \'\' With that being said , it did n\'t really matter to me , a good book is a good book , no matter the political implications or insinuations . About the book : The plot was weak , it could have used a lot less quoting and preaching and a lot more character development and background . I found myself being thrown into a whole lot of speeches and little narrative or story development . The original character descriptions were good , but I found myself wanting to know more about them , who they were really , where they came from , and what they were thinking . The protagonist of this story was the only character that was explored deeper than a name , physical description , and a little about their backgrounds . I wanted to know more about them ESPECIALLY what they were thinking . The writing was a little below average . Mr. Beck just is n\'t that good of a story teller , I found myself drifting through the quotes and preaching , wanting them to be over so the story could continue ... which it never really did . There was never a climax in the story , and the ending left a lot to be desired . You would have expected to learn a lot more of the elder Mr. Gardner ( the main character \'s father ) before the last chapter . Additionally , I felt that it ended without anything being solved . It just kind of ended in what I would think of as the middle of the story . All in all this was not worth the day and a half I put into reading it , and I suggest if Mr. Beck wants to share his political ideology , he stick to non-fiction . I would be happy to read it , and would probably enjoy it . Why write a fiction book , when really all you want to do is write a book of facts regarding the corruption of our country ? That \'s what we really need to hear and read ... hiding all of that in the guise of a fiction story ( dubbed a thriller , no less ) is disappointing to those of us who want to read a good novel . * * * NOTE : For all of you who are going to call me a biased liberal hippie , I am a former employee and lifetime member of the National Rifle Association ( thanks to Mr. Beck for the kudos in the book ) , and a member of the libertarian party .

230,39_1_R3METPXK6OG0V.txt,' This could be one of the most important books you ever read . The Secret Life of Bill Clinton is essential to understanding the serious corruption that has infested our government under Bill Clinton . Most significantly , Ambrose Evans-Pritchard \'s exposure of the existence and workings of the murderous Arkansas mafia from which Bill Clinton hatched is something every American should understand - particularly that Clinton brought elements of it with him right into the White House . Drug-trafficker Dan Lasater \'s chief lieutenant Patsy Thomasson , for example , is Clinton \'s Director of the White House Office of Administration . In no other book are the ugly facts and sinister associations laid with such stark clarity . Evans-Pritchard writes with a clear and graceful style , laced with doses of dry English wit . Reviewing the fishy crime scene evidence relating to the gun found in Vincent Foster \'s hand , for example , he observes : & quot ; The revolver ... had not found its final resting place . The crime scene photos show it hopping about in a most animated way in Foster \'s hand. & quot ; As a result of Evans-Pritchard being one of the small handful of journalists who actually investigated the death of Vincent Foster and certain other Clinton-related matters , he developed contacts and relationships with key witnesses and others that provide his his book with devestating factual revelations that can not be found elsewhere . For example , the first person known to have seen Vincent Foster \'s body in Fort Marcy Park , officially known as the & quot ; Confidential Witness & quot ; is absolutely certain that at the time he saw the body there was no gun . He tells Evans-Pritchard : & quot ; The whole thing stinks , he clearly did n\'t shoot himself there . You ca n\'t shoot yourself without a gun . The man had no gun . End of story. & quot ; Another example : Jerry Parks was a Little Rock private investigator with long-standing ties to Vincent Foster , as well as having been head of security for the 1992 Clinton-Gore headquarters in Little Rock . He had a file on Clinton extra-marital affairs that Foster had hired him to compile several years earlier . He was murdered gangland-style two months after the Foster death and the files were stolen . Evans-Pritchard , over a several-year period , was able to get Parks \' widow and son to open up to him and provide extraordinary revelations tying his murder to the White House . Evans-Pritchard , an Englishman , has an obvious affection for this country and an admiration for the finer qualities of the American character . His protagonists are the ordinary people who fight the abuses of power and corruption from their little corner . & quot ; It makes me feel almost proud to witness such defiance , & quot ; he says . I was moved by his seeing the virtue in our country and its people while in the midst of exposing the putrid evil and corruption that few seem to realize even exists . I wonder what motivated the man , a Brit on temporary assignment in the U.S. , to perform the tremendous service to this country that I believe he has . I do n\'t know , but I suspect it is a highly developed sense of justice and a properly aroused moral indignation . He came to the U.S. at the end of 1992 as an admirer of Bill and Hillary Clinton , but over time came to realize they were very different from their packaging . He explains & quot ; Sending people to prison on false charges - or trying to do so - is his [ Clinton \'s ] specialty , which is the chief reason I have come to revile the man. & quot ; Of course , if you only get your information from the mainstream media , you would n\'t have any idea of what he is talking about - which is all the more reason to read this book . Evans-Pritchard wrote a farewell article when he left America to return to England , the subtitle of which was & quot ; Rouse and Guard Your Liberties. & quot ; The warning is apt , but you will have to read the book to understand why .

And I have literally heard thousands - from all over the world . I \'ve been in this game a long time . And young Kesha has much , MUCH to learn . The lyrics are chock-full of drug and alcohol references , the vocals are auto-tune heavy , and the blips and blats of electronica that litter EVERY stinking track could have been put to better use . As a fellow reviewer mentioned earlier , the album lacks cohesion , as Kesha is unsure of herself at best . Lady Gaga , Cascada , and Kim Sozzi have better dance albums out right now WITHOUT all of the professional cooks who had their hands on this project .... with Gaga it all boils down to her extreme confidence and exhuberance . She relies not on studio-enhanced vocals , name-dropping , and junior high school lyrics . One look at the song titles and it pretty much gives away the content of the album . THe lyrics are so ridiculous and pretentious that the listener can not enjoy the beats and the melodies , which in certain cases are not that bad . The whole point of a dance-pop record is so the listener can dance away their troubles . These lyrics are so bizarre and unnerving at times that the focus is entirely on Kesha and her dirty party-girl image . Most people who buy dance records do n\'t care about the vocalist . It \'s all about the mood and the beats . This album sounds like the songs were both written and performed by a 14 year old raver while she was in rehab or a mental facility .

Since the course of true love is never smooth , it should come as no surprise that Allie \'s parents do not approve of her relationship with Noah .

With one in hand and actually using the device , I can honestly say it is an excellent , gorgeous , piece of hardware . The biggest flaw , it weighs a ton . The weight does n\'t sound like a bad thing , but after I held this device in both hands while laying down , my arms got sore . It \'s a small thing , but you should be aware that it is heavy . Set up was super simple . Connect the unit to your computer , run iTunes , follow the wizard . About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated . The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason . If you have an iPhone already , the set up is a bit easier . It will inherit most of your settings . Once activated , you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings . All pretty obvious , top to bottom , essentially all the same as the iPhone . Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone \'s 5W charger . So you \'ll have to use that charger . There is a big negative , you \'ll have to cart around that charger , most USB ports will not charge this device . My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports , and it will not charge my iPad . External battery packs will work with no trouble charging , or extending the use . Battery life - I ran video , downloaded a ton of apps , and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10 \% of the battery life was used . I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate . Typing is easier than on an iPhone , but still not keyboard easy . There \'s a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time . I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs . I ca n\'t seem to get it with the iPad . The other problem , the device has a rounded back , so if you place it on a table and try to type , the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly . I do n\'t think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device . Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous . They are full of detail and easy to read . Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great ( useable but not great ) . You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you .

There is just no comparison to the iPhone \'s horrible display of WebPages . Email takes on a whole new look . Embedded pictures display beautifully . There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox . Navigation is just a pleasure . Account switching is a little different from the iPhone , but still very intuitive . Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view . Video is stunning . Netflix over high speed WiFi ( my connection is 22Mbps ) delivers full screen , highly detailed , smooth video with good sound . Any video created for the iPhone plays , but they are significantly pixilated or blocky , basically you \'ve blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size . Those videos are viewable , but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size . Some of the free apps I \'ve tried . ABC is simple and stunning for watching video , but lacks a lot of programs . Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing , something not available on any other computer - very handy feature . USA Today has done an awful job , the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless . Weatherbug is incredible , simple and to the point , but with a ton of forecast information ( including webcams for different weatherbug stations ) . NASA is silly , an enlarged version of their iPhone app . Pandora works perfectly as expected . The iPod / music side plays like I expected . Nothing really new there . The oddity though , iPod / music is on the home base menu , but video is a separate application . Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right . I \'ve had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use . I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise . The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast , simple to use , and a gorgeous screen . I also own a netbook . The iPad is a much better device . I love this device . Is it a revolution in computing ? Only time will tell . For the moment , this is the best video , audio , email , web browsing device I \'ve ever seen . Go try it at a store . I think you will fall in love . April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both . The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers . e-Ink is easy on the eyes , it looks just like a book . Where ever you can read a book , you can read a Kindle . The Kindle is light weight , about on par with a real book , maybe a bit lighter . And the plastic has a really fine satin feel . After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle , I do n\'t think of the device anymore . The iPad - pages look gorgeous . Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning , with the color images , the perfect page layout , sharp beautiful type , fun page turning animation , and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book . But , it weighs a lot more than a book , more like a big old heavy text book . The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle . I keep thinking , this is such a cool device that I do n\'t lose myself in the reading . Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap , under a minute and I \'ve got my book . Buying them with the iPad ? Sorry I \'ll never buy a book through iTunes , just like I \'ve never bought a song at iTunes . Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books . But , and here \'s the big but , the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software . They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience , just like they love buying music through iTunes . It will be a success . The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle , or a Sony reader , or a Nook . There just is no substitute for e-Ink . And , yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen ; and no you ca n\'t read a book easily in the sun ( especially not the beach ) . And if you think I \'m silly saying the device is heavy - there \'s three pretty savvy tech people that agree , Patrick Norton ( a big strong guy ) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla ( an intense WOW gamer , so she has strong hands ) , and Molly Wood of CNet . Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons . ',normal
248,6_11_R1JTSLI61PAO70.txt,' This 70 pg . book was originally published in 1956 in the journal Psychoanalysis as `` Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters \'\' . As one can derive from this title , the author has attempted to present us with a deeper understanding of certain chess masters using psychoanalysis , and in the process comes up with some interesting but also peculiar ( in my opinion , at least ) insights . In particular , Fine discusses the following players : Staunton , Anderssen , Morphy , Steinetz , Lasker , Capablanca , Alekhine , Euwe , and Botvinnik . For someone not familiar with the personalities of these exceptional players , Fine \'s anecdotal accounts of their personalities and eccentricities is quite facinating . What kind of made me leary was the general remarks that the author makes in regards to chess and chess players , and how in particular he seems to sexualize the purpose of chess . For instance , on page 22 he states : `` The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification of the homosexual wish , particularly the desire for mutual masterbation . This is , of course , completely repressed . Checkmate may be seen as rendering the father impotent , again part of the homosexual complex . \'\' Oh , really ? And here I thoight that chess was a game , to be played for fun and enjoyment , or in some cases competatively . I ca n\'t quite remember ever feeling that it was the expression of a `` desire for mutual masterbation \'\' -- well , how could I , because I ca n\'t , since I \'m repressing it . Well , that \'s just pure bunk , in my opinion . Fortunately , this book is n\'t entirely like this , so it does have its merits , but it clearly is n\'t must-read chess literature . ',normal
249,24_2_R1W6YGULHYVVXL.txt,' The original Mass Effect had a few flaws , but I consider it to be a solid game . When Bioware developed this sequel , it seems like they tried to `` fix \'\' a little too much . Mass Effect 2 game feels more like a shooter than its predecessor and the combat is less forgiving even on the `` casual \'\' setting , which is disappointing for anyone who liked the more relaxed pace of the first game . However , it retains several RPG elements to maintain the series \' feeling of depth , which might annoy gamers who want to get straight to the action . It \'s a classic case of trying to please everyone and sacrificing the overall quality in the process . That being said , there \'s still plenty to like in this game . Heavy weapons are a welcome addition , the Mako vehicle is a thankful omission , and the game is just as polished overall as the original was . If you \'re a shooter fan who \'s a little burned out on Halo 3 : ODST and Modern Warfare 2 , or are planning on picking up Bioshock 2 , you may want to skip this title . Fans of the first game will be a little disappointed , but they should enjoy the return of Commander Shepherd . ',normal
250,10_18_R30TK050962DZV.txt,' Journalist Weisberg here cashes in on the current disgust with George W. Bush by trying to make his disastrous presidency into a tragedy , largely through analogies with Henry V , Winston Churchill , and Woodrow Wilson . Bush nevertheless remains a frat boy who is pushed up into power by the greed and malevolence of the Republican party . That is the tragedy -- that a great nation could be hoodwinked into voting for someone not even qualified for local dog catcher . As such the story is a terrible farce . The only real contribution is a good assessment of the much over exaggerated role of Dick Cheney in the formulation of Bush policy . Cheney remains an evil presence but hardly the power behind the throne . Bush is stupid but not so stupid as to allow himself to be manipulated . He above all wanted to exert his own will himself . His relationship with his father is not at all unusual , except that his father was president . The book relies on half-baked psychological theories and borrowings from the Freud-Bullitt volume on the peculiar personality of Woodrow Wilson . It is not particularly convincing or useful . As we prepare to elect yet another president we might at least learn to beware . ',ironisch

254,16_16_ROD7DNPFJ3NJ7.txt,' Finding Nemo is the fifth installment for Pixar Studios , the most reliable studio in Hollywood today , and it is my personal favorite . The first obviously outstanding aspect of the movie is the animation . From the breathtaking wonder of the Great Barrier Reef , to the cold , sterile fish tank , the animation is top notch and truly state of the art . The water , which has always been the bane of animation , is picture perfect , and the animators have captured the rolling but constant ocean and the light refractions perfectly . But animation itself does n\'t make a film . Finding Nemo \'s strongest aspect is it \'s warm , witty , heartfelt , and funny story of a father \'s quest to reclaim his son . The kids will love the vibrant characters and funny situations , and so will the parents . However , the parents will be able to enjoy the film on a level far more than the kids will . The story is about losing a child , and the desperate quest to be reunited , which will hit the parent right in the gut . This is the story \'s dark side , which has , thankfully , not been sugar coated by the creators . Overall , lets just say Halleluja , Pixar , you \'ve done it again ! ',normal
255,19_2_R3QCP3MCXY4JFZ.txt,' I was heartbroken when it was cancelled and became a huge fan of directv when they picked it up for season 3 ... BUT I just read on [ ... ] ( which is linked to Amazon ) that they are releasing only the shortened/edited NBC season 3 - not the full episodes aired on directv \'s Channel 101 . AND changing the music for the dvds . Basically , the fans and directv saved this show - and NBC is going to shaft the fans-AGAIN- by releasing shortened episodes instead of full directv episodes . I \'m SOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD . How much more could it really cost to release the entire episodes ? And something has to be done to negotiate use of the music up front because fans of all shows usually love the music that was originally chosen by the original creative forces behind the show - rather than after the fact , haphazard changing the music to save money . If you are willing to spend $ 30 on season 3 ( or buy it on sale ) - you would probably spend $ 40 just as easily to get the full episodes with the real music . What a racket ! I usually hate 1 star reviews that have nothing to do with the show - but the way it was released ( like a volume 1 etc . just to make money ) but when the way it is being released means you have no access to the full episodes on dvd-I think it deserves 1 star because it is content related . At least with a volume 1 , they may be squeezing you for money but you know you have the option to buy volume 2 and get the entire season . This way , you just get edited episodes - with no hope of full episodes . By the way , it also said there would be a season 4 & 5 - YAHOO ! ! ',ironisch

261,276425_5_R2QH89ZOFU88PF.txt,' We have two Roombas plus a Scooba in our house . When one of the batteries on one of our Roombas finally reached the end of its life cycle , we decided to donate that Roomba to a friend and to get ourselves the new top of the line - the Roomba 560 . We got this right when it first came out , but we waited several months before posting a review . It \'s pretty much impossible to review one of these Roombas after only a few days ! It takes weeks if not months to start to see how well they last over time , and what breaks down . Believe me - been there , done that . So now it \'s many months later , and I have to say , we are quite pleased with the improvements of this Roomba over the previous generations of Roombas . So first , for those who do n\'t even have ANY Roomba yet ( hard to believe ! ) . Roombas are awesome . We have cats , and we work from home so we \'re home all day . It is AMAZING how much dirt and dust and junk collects in the carpet every single day . Who really has time to vacuum their carpets twice a day any more ? With the Roomba , you set the scheduler to do it while you are asleep . You wake up in the morning , the carpets are clean , the air is fresh , and you empty out the dust bin . It is just wonderful . Even those without pets might be amazed how much lint and such the Roomba will find every morning for you . I have a noise meter and have done several tests with the noise meter . The Roomba is much quieter than other regular vacuums . It is NOT silent - it ca n\'t be ! How could it vacuum up dirt and be silent ? But it is quieter than the alternatives , and heck , you \'re sleeping anyway . I can easily sleep through a Roomba running . Now , on to the improvements of this new Roomba over previous models . First , it has a cool feature where the speed drops when it senses it is approaching a solid object . The old Roomba would just run full tilt into an object - wall , couch etc . - and then turn around . This one slows down so that it hits the object gently . Sure the old Roomba would n\'t dent the walls with its powerful force , but still , it \'s nice to have it be gentle on furniture and your building . Next , for better or for worse , the new Roomba is much more aware of when its bin and brushes are getting grungy . I admit I did n\'t clean my other Roombas as often as I should have . And it led to problems . This new Roomba will actually stop and warn you when it \'s getting full and when the brushes should be cleaned . If you \'re a procrastinator like I am , this is a good thing . If you \'re a clean freak that empties the bin every time , and cleans the brushes every time , then you probably wo n\'t even notice this feature . The anti tangle technology is nice . The previous Roomba would start to eat a cord and just keep going until it was really stuck . This Roomba at least tries to get itself untangled . Still , I do n\'t recommend leaving cords and strings and things lying around . You \'re just asking for trouble if you do . The new system uses a `` lighthouse \'\' instead of just a wall . With a lighthouse , you mark out a room so the Roomba finishes with that room completely before going on to the next room . They are like section markers . We tend to just use walls , but if you have two large rooms the lighthouse feature might be really helpful for you . After several months of running we have had NO problems at all with our Roomba . No broken brushes , no falling off pieces , nothing . It is still going strong and we are very pleased with it . Highly , highly recommended !

I love Roombas , they have saved me countless hours of work , and they make my home a much cleaner and easier-breathing place to be . ',normal

264,10_11_R39E2L0925XWH1.txt,' First , I am not in the expected fan base for Jonas Brothers . Not by a long shot . However , their lyrics are clean and their hooks catchy and the boys are n\'t hard on the eyes ; all of that has me won over before hearing anything else . In their new CD the songs are n\'t just catchy , they are flat out contagious . If I am not listening , I have found myself singing or humming the songs . Repeatedly . I have to hand it to JB for maturing their sound in the right way . Most `` boy bands \'\' go on the extreme of `` we \'re not kids anymore \'\' when they try to branch out their sound . JB has done it right : writing relevant songs to their lives in a sophisticated and mature way . The band boasts a wider variety of instruments and the metaphorical writing suits them wonderfully . Another positive ( for me at least ) is being able to hear more of Kevin \'s singing . He \'s still all harmony but at least you can tell it \'s him singing . That \'s not been the case in the songs I \'ve purchased before . Overall , this CD is excellent . It \'s clear the guys will be around for a while and they and their fans wo n\'t be doomed to bubblegum for the duration . World War III : 4/5 Angsty and fiesty and fun . A bit hard to listen to the first go round because it is so aggressive but by the end you \'re sold . Paranoid : 4/5 Their first release from the album . Definitely one you \'ll find yourself humming when you are n\'t paying attention . I always think I am sick of it until I hear it again and then I realize that , nope , it \'s still pretty good . Fly with me : 5/5 From Night at the Museum 2 and honestly , one of the best tracks . We still get the bubbly and sweet lyrics but the music is something more than just catchy . `` Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine ... \'\' lyric just seals the deal for me . Poison Ivy : 3/5 Most contagious track by far , literally and of course , metaphorically . We all want what is n\'t good for us but we all hate that we want it . Redundant lyrics but insanely awesome music . Hey Baby : 3/5 Good but not great . Catchy but not memorable . Filler song for me . ( Update : After listening to this song more , I appreciate it more than when I wrote the review . If I had to rate it now , I would actually give it a 4/5 . As far as songwriting and performance goes , it \'s probably a 5 but it just does n\'t have the memorable catch that Fly With Me or Turn Right have , so I ca n\'t give it a full 5 ) . Before the Storm : 4/5 Thankfully Miley does n\'t over-sing and the writing and performing of this song are tender and sweet . It is clear that Nick and Miley mean every word . What did I do to your Heart : 5/5 This song is just F-U-N , fun ! Love the country influence . The only improvement that could be made is Kevin on a banjo . Much Better : 4/5 Brilliant . I \'m a T.S . fan but what a joy to see her get a dose of her own medicine . While it \'s never stated to be directed at her , honestly , you ca n\'t help but to raise an eyebrow at : `` Got a rep for breaking hearts/ Now I \'m done with superstars/ and all the tears on her guitar/ I \'m not bitter ... \'\' Really been waiting for Joe to get some sort of say in the matter and this satisfies me completely . My only issue with this song is that it does n\'t need a horn and guitar solo both . I \'m sure it will be great live , but too much for the CD . ( Update , I did see JB live , with my daughter this summer . It was n\'t their full set since they were actually only headlining a city celebration . They did play this song and I have to admit , I did n\'t notice the horn and guitar solo being as cumbersome as it was on the CD . Either they trimmed it , or it was just so amazing live that I did n\'t have time to notice it . It really does play better live . ) Black Keys : 5/5 Nick \'s experiment with writing on the black keys of the piano . Hauntingly beautiful melody is the result and the lyrics are typical , tender Nick . Do n\'t Charge me for the Crime : 2/5 Like WWIII , it takes a listen or two but then you can appreciate it . Complete metaphor for how far you should or should n\'t go to help a friend ( are people actually taking the lyrics seriously ? ) Clearly an experiment and here you see ( hear ) some growing pains . Turn Right : 5/5 My absolute personal favorite on the entire CD . The all acoustic suits them so well when they let themselves commit to it completely . Kevin played piano on this at the Wal-mart sound check concert but does n\'t get any listing on the CD for it , so I do n\'t know if he recorded the piano , but if so , it \'s cool to hear him play other instruments . Do n\'t Speak : 3/5 They say they wrote it in the vein of U2 , Kings of Leon , Mutemath and some others . I hear U2 all over it the most . Not my favorite song but an absolute cross-over to my age bracket ( mid-30s ) if they were aiming for that . Definitely a slower paced song for them as far as story telling and theme . Will do well though on radio play if they choose to release it . Keep it Real : 4/5 Bonus track from their sitcom . Classic JB , catchy and a little kitchy but absolutely fun . Completely worth every penny whether you \'re 12 or 32 . Update : Even though very few of their songs actually rated the full 5 stars for me , the album as a whole is a great package , which is why I gave it 5 stars . Sometimes breaking it apart piece by piece you can see the chinks in the armor , but over all , 3 months later , I am still listening to this entire album almost daily -- not as a teenager , but a much older than these guys adult . That alone should hold up any 5 star rating in my book . ',normal

Second , here is why you should buy it . & quot ; Either/Or & quot ; is Elliot \'s 3rd solo release , following 3 albums and several EPs with the Portland indie/grunge band Heatmiser . I ca n\'t speak for & quot ; roman candle & quot ; or & quot ; Elliot Smith , & quot ; but i can tell you about this album ... which is one of the best i have ever heard . As several other reviews said , this album has an ethereal , acoustic sound , best compared to Simon and Garfunkel or Nick Drake . The songs - short , but beautiful - are vintage Elliot , with moody , depressing lyrics generally about the girl who got away - and why it \'s his own fault . & quot ; Nobody broke your heart ... you broke your own cuz you ca n\'t finish what you start , & quot ; he chants over and over on & quot ; Alameda. & quot ; Elliot utilizes both complex , Dylanesque lines along with simple , powerful phrases like the chorus of & quot ; Ballad of Big Nothing & quot ; to create truly moving songs ... and if that \'s not enough , Elliot is a fine singer . The highlight of many songs is the vocal melody , especially on the bright & quot ; Rose Parade. & quot ; Elliot \'s trademarke guitar work is here , of course - his pick/strum chord-oriented songs comprise the bulk of the album . The music stands on it \'s own , yet creates a suberb backing for Elliot \'s singing and lyrics . This is one of his best albums , and i would consider it stronger than XO , which has been more universally acclaimed ( even by this website ! ) . A few standout tracks - of course , the songs from Good Will Hunting ... & quot ; Ballad of Big Nothing & quot ; & quot ; Say Yes & quot ; and & quot ; Between the Bars. & quot ; The entire album is great , however , with not a single weak track . You should pick this one up - everyone should give & quot ; Either/Or & quot ; a chance , because someday it will stand as one of the finest albums produced during the 1990 \'s ... and maybe ever .

270,29_9_R1X7MUT4QTAN4A.txt,' Hellhound on his Trail is an outstanding book . Sides writes about all that happened before and after the assasination of ML King In Memphis in 1968 . His writing style is captivating at a minimum . Even though we know how it turns out , I could n\'t put the book down . The reader learns what is going on inside the King organization prior to the killing and what is going on with the assassin , James Earl Ray . The author is from Memphis and his love and concern for the city shows in the way he invovles Memphis in the unfolding drama .

They overcome all odds in their quest for great physical/emotional love . Oh , least I forget , the usual sad , abused pasts for both of our versatile protagonists . Fortunately , the contrived angst did n\'t overwhelm the salacious narrative . The real story is the sensual appetite of these two lovers . They achieve physical satisfaction in the vertical , horizontal , dorsal and ventral positions , whether clothed or unclothed , in private or in public . Hooray for Passion ! What stamina ! I can not say that this was well written . No . Nor was there any remarkable literary form or style - excepting the overuse of the common street terms for male and female reproductive organs .

279,50_6_R2VHNRY63VQFRG.txt,' This is a very clever book on developing speed reading . The author disguised it as a nonfiction account of the `` liberal \'\' news media , but as I discovered , if you only read the pages in which the author provides verifiable facts to support his reasoning , then you can finish the book before moving from the library book shelf . Imagine , two hundred pages in five minutes ! I almost got finger blisters turning the pages so quickly . I learned years ago in college that when reading a non-fiction book , other than , let \'s say , most memoirs , that if the book is without reference materials , a bibliography , or notes that allows the reader to verify the information , then the book is most likely a sham . `` Bias \'\' has zero references that would allow the curious reader to independently authenticate the writer \'s claims . I also did not notice at least semi-complete transcripts to allow for the writer \'s alleged quotes to be understood in context . The author is strictly operating on a `` trust me \'\' basis . If that \'s good enough for you , then I have a 70 \'s VW to sell you ( only driven once , really would I lie ! ) . Regardless of your political orientation , the author should desire an intelligent audience . By stating his views as proven facts , the author violates the trust given by his audience to treat them with intellectual respect . Another book , `` What Liberal Media ? The Truth About Bias and the News \'\' by Eric Alterman , actually considers the accusations of the Bias author and finds the claims lacking substance . Sure , Alterman is a liberal , but he gives a full forty pages of references ( roughly a fifth of the Bias book \'s total pages ) to back up his claims , and to allow the reader to look for her/himself . In sum , if you want to know who is `` Biased \'\' consider who is preferring to hide the information vs. who gives it to you to make up your own mind . I do n\'t have to agree with all of Alterman \'s conclusions , but at least he gives me the opportunity to judge the facts on my own . ',ironisch

Maybe it helps that I \'m a & quot ; liberal & quot ; -- but what makes this a good book rather than just a book that says things I happen to agree with is that it \'s clever and well-executed . The humor runs from silly to witty , but it \'s pretty consistently funny . It \'s too bad the satire seems to be lost on some people . The point of the book is that Franken is using the same methods that Rush Limbaugh & amp ; co. use in a _satirical_ fashion in order to expose these methods as ridiculous . Take his & quot ; interview & quot ; with Rush Limbaugh , modeled after the latter \'s & quot ; interview & quot ; with Hillary Clinton . Yes , obviously it \'s quite easy to come up with the same sort of & quot ; interview & quot ; with Al Franken , but that does n\'t do much to hurt his case . The point of the Rush Limbaugh interview is n\'t so much to make Rush admit that he is indeed a big fat idiot by taking his words out of context as to make fun of the idea of such an interview as a cheap shot with which you can make anyone say anything . So you ca n\'t really use Franken \'s methods against him to make him out to be a hypocrite , because the basis of the book is a humorous refutation of those very methods .

287,40_17_R1FQTBWDI9VQOX.txt,' Some drama films are the kind that you feel emotional resonance for the characters , feel mildly engaged by the plot , think about it for a few seconds after leaving the theater , get into your car , get pissed off at a stupid driver , and quickly move back into your own life . The Lovely Bones is n\'t that kind of movie . Director Peter Jackson , of Lord of the Rings and King Kong fame , does n\'t seem like the most obvious choice to direct the adaptation of the seemingly untouchable Alice Sebold novel , but he does his best , by staying close to the source material , but occasionally taking things out here and there . He also brings alot of ah-mazing CGI shots that are so gorgeous , they may be worth the price of admission alone , and I doubt we would \'ve had that type of a movie if anybody else had directed it . However , you get the feeling that Jackson paid too much attention to the CGI aspect , while he could \'ve dealt with the center plot issue with more directorial sensitivity , mocking the same way the book was written , and that \'s what stops this from being a perfect movie . The plot centers around Susie Salmon ( played by Saoirse Ronan ) , a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered in 1973 . Ronan was absolutely perfect in this role . She showed promise in the 2007 film Atonement , where she also played a terrified youth who is dealing with an unbelievable situation . In the film , Susie is watching over her family , the boy she was in love with , and her killer -- from her own personal heaven . Stanley Tucci nails his role , playing the demented serial killer Mr. Harvey . He gives a particularly chilling , and uncannily believable performance , showing more versatility with every film he makes , you can tell that he really got lost in this role , because his part is n\'t one of those where you find yourself wondering what the actor has previously starred in -- you see his character , and he does a damn fine job at it . Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon play Susie \'s family , and each of those roles require the actor to display quite alot of emotion , grieving her loss , and they all do terrific work , causing you to feel the extreme remorse that their characters do , and I really do n\'t know if better actors could have been selected to play the respective parts . Nikki SooHoo plays Holly , a girl who Susie meets in heaven , another victim of Mr. Harvey . Her role is particularly memorable , serving as something of a reassuring voice to the Ronan \'s character , and I see her doing great things in her future , because , while being an unknown actress , she shows just as much talent as the other actors in this all-star cast . The core of this movie , however , the reason to go and see it in a packed theatre , does n\'t lie in its acting , or the writing , or even the direction . It lies in the story . We \'ve all wondered what happens to us after we die . The Lovely Bones suggests that we go to a world that we think is perfect , but we \'re still haunted by the things that troubled us in our lives . And while the movie leaves you heartbroken , wanting to spend every day you have on this earth as your last , it leaves you pondering your own life , the significance of it , how you \'ll be remembered . And that \'s something I particularly like in a film , when it not only moves you to the point where tears are flooding your eyes , but when it leaves you with a great deal of psychological issues to ponder , about your own life , and what comes after your life is ultimately over . And that \'s what The Lovely Bones does . And while staying true to the source material , that \'s all a fan of this story can ask for . ',normal

I have been in love with the G1 since it came out a year ago , but I could n\'t get over that ugly chin sticking out ! I was beyond ecstatic when the MyTouch 3G was released , but after playing with the device for 3 hours I realized what a piece of crap it was and returned it . The screen was n\'t that big and it made texting and instant messaging a living nightmare . In addition to that , the phone was not multi-touch capable , so if you \'re a fast texter and really quick with the emails then the MyTouch 3G is not for you . The virtual keyboard could only handle one letter at a time and I found myself hitting the wrong letters on so many occasions . I would hit a letter and the phone would pick up the surroundings letter . This really is ashame because the thirty-five dollar data plan is mandatory and its travesty that one ca n\'t even use it to the best of their ability . The lack of a keyboard also made the MyTouch 3G a big downer . Anyway , I digress . Now , let \'s get to the Motorola Cliq . This phone is everything that the G1 and MyTouch 3G should have been , but better . This device does n\'t come with Eclair ( Android OS 2.0 ) , but it functions just fine . Hopefully a mandatory upgrade will be made available to all Android users soon . This is a great PDA smart phone for anyone who is heavy into texting , emailing , and surfing the web . It \'s a full featured phone , but at the same time it \'s nothing groundbreaking . There is definitely some acclimation when it comes to the Cliq because I am so use to my Blackberry 8900 and I think its one of the best built devices with a very responsive well built OS . If you \'re looking for a device that is very similar to the iPhone on the T-Mobile network then this is probably the closest that you will ever get . My initial impression of the phone was not a good one because it kept asking me to create a user name and password . I thought it was asking for an email address ( Yahoo , AOL , Gmail ) , but it was n\'t . It was asking you to create a MotoBlur account . I did , but kept getting an error message . T-Mobile customer service did n\'t know what to do and [ ... ] has an area to sign into MotoBlur & an option to create a motoblur account , but when you click it there \'s nothing on screen that lets you create a name/password . Android OS - Many people have said that the Android OS is a game changer since its release back in the fall of 2008 . It seemed like the only thing at the time to combat with the forces of the iPhone . To some extent it is and to some extent it \'s just not quite there yet . To be honest it \'s a bit on the clunky side . It does take a few seconds to exit out of certain applications , or to even get to the main home screen menu when exiting out of email and texting . When you become so use to using your cell phone for just about everything - speed is everything . That also includes how responsive and quick your phones OS is . My only gripe is that I wish there was n\'t that few second lag in-between operations . Motoblur - The Cliq includes MotoBlur which lets you connect your Facebook , MySpace , and twitter accounts directly to the advice , so whenever your friend writes a new comment it immediately goes to the homepage of the phone . This is a great idea and saves you time from going into the web browser and having to log in each account in order to check for updates . However , this feature is a battery killer . I have mine turns off , besides if you lend your phone to someone else to use ( To make a call or use web browser ) they will all be up in your business . I could careless about this feature . Email - This is also not an Android device that has Google branding with it . It \'s just a Motorola phone using the Android OS . There is NO G1 branding logo anywhere . However , you can still sync up your Google email address , but the Gmail feature is such a disappointment . Synchronization has to be turned on for the Gmail to function to the best of its ability & that \'s a BIG battery draining feature . You can also sync your Yahoo & AOL email addresses . The AOL and Yahoo email feature is way better then Gmail and does n\'t require synchronization to be turned on . This helps save tremendous battery power . When you send an email from your desktop it does n\'t come to the phone right away , but you can set the phone to check for new emails every 15 mins , 30 mins , or manually , etc . It does n\'t work the same with Gmail which is a big let down . I am a big fan of the Blackberry and it \'s the only device on the market that gets an email within 2 seconds of sending it . The same ca n\'t be said for the Android OS . Much work needs to be done . Web Browser - One of the best features on any android device including the Cliq is the web browser . Surprisingly , it does n\'t launch [ ... ] as the main homepae when you click browser . The Android Browser is probably one of the best browsers on the market right now and is up there with the Safari Browser and the Palm Pre \'s browser . You cant pinch and zoom to enlarge the way you can on the iPhone , but there are zoom in controls which are easy to use . You also get a dedicated YouTube app that lets you watch Youtube videos . Though the video clips are n\'t as sharp as the iPhone - There is a setting and option when you are watching the YouTube clip where you can see the videos in `` Higher Quality \'\' so its crystal sharp and less blurry . There is a big difference that one will notice when switching from standard to HIGHER QUALITY . 3G - TMobile recently launched their 3G network about a little over a year ago , so they are still building from the ground up while the other networks are already moving into 4G . It \'s great that the CLIQ has 3G , but it does get spotty and unresponsive sometimes . There were many times that the 3G would switch between 3G and EDGE . I did n\'t have that big of a problem with it , but I am sure over time it will get better . Wi-Fi is also included , so this is a great alternative for someone who might be at home and only has EDGE access . Instant Messaging - The CLIQ comes with Yahoo Messenger , Google Talk , and AIM pre-installed . My Blackberry 8900 came with all 3 and included ICQ & Windows Live . Another thing about the IM that was such a disappointment is that synchronization had to be activated in order for you to sign into the messaging client , which in turn drains the battery power like crazy . This was such a disappointment . My BB never had this issue . You sign in and start chatting . There was no extra setting that had to be activated in order to chat , but on the CLIQ it \'s a requirement . The extra requirement only means that you have to charge you phone twice in one day because of heavy unnecessary usage . Motorola really could have done a better job with the CLIQ , especially for the price . But I think most of the minor flaws have to do with the Android OS . I was originally an iPhone user that became a Blackberry user and I have to hand it to the Blackberry because it \'s quick , responsive , and built in such a way that its function is superb . Everything from Email to text to instant messaging is just so quick . There is hardly any lag and it \'s easy to learn how to use . The Blackberry so far is the best PDA I have ever used , but its web browser needs work . Pick up the CLIQ phone because it \'s a winner . There are some minor flaws , but the pros outweigh the negative . Pros : Android OS ( Can be a pro & a con ) Full HTML Web Browser Threaded Text message Email sync Android Marketplace Full qwerty keyboard YouTube Application 5.0 camera/camcorder Big vibrant screen 3.5 MM headjack Decent call quality ( No issues yet ) Mini SD up to 32GB Use your songs as ringers Wi-Fi Personal Email ( Up to 10 accounts can be added ) IM My Favs Excellent Multimedia Player Includes 2 chargers ( Wall Charger & USB charger ) T-Mobile offers the best minute and data plans on this planet Cons : Poor Battery Life ( Lower light setting and turn off Motoblur to save power ) Gmail is a disaster ( Not push capable ) Needs better notification options when next text/emails come through No PUSH email capability Trackball ( I miss you ) Occasional lag time when entering/exiting a screen/app Micro USB ( No more Mini USB ) No ear phone or free carry case ',normal

313,8_4_R2YXG32QDNGF0I.txt,' Lambert seems to be throwback to the `` bigger than life \'\' rock popularized by Bowie and Freddie Mercury and he pulls off this sound with sophistication and aplomb .

The first three cuts hit hard , with up tempo beats and a surprisingly plaintive vocal on `` Whattaya Want From Me \'\' gives the listener a good indication of what Lambert can do . `` Strut \'\' then takes things into more stylized mode and Lambert shows a bit of the over the top quality so necessary to pull off this style of song .

A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug . 2 ) David Bowie . Need I say more ? Someone needs to explain the why \'s and wherefore \'s of this whole `` sparkly vampire \'\' business to me . I really do n\'t understand it at all . Going out in daylight ... OK , Dracula could do it if he were well fed , so why not ? But sparkles ? Anyway on to the meat of this review ... ( which will likely get thoroughly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick ) As far as I can tell , Twilight has no plot . At all . There are n\'t any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so . There is n\'t any drama . This is a vampire movie with no conflict among the main characters , only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other . The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags . Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences . The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives . Nothing \'s really keeping them apart . The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers did n\'t have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment `` the new girl . \'\' Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella \'s sheriff dad and the `` maulings \'\' ( read : vampire attacks ) he \'s investigating . But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward \'s wangsting . Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue , I agree . This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across . Everyone likes her . She always gets her way . People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so . To make things worse , I found her to be a horrible character in general . There \'s one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she is n\'t paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention , preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance . I \'m sorry , but that \'s just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed . I do n\'t care if the poor guy is a bit character , I \'d rather a small look at any of the their small dramas , because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film . Speaking of small bit characters , the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the `` OMG bad vampires . \'\' I \'ll give the redshirt credit , the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth , he would have fought them off . : ) Go redshirt , go ! I \'m told that scene was not in the books . It makes me lose all desire to ever read them . As seems to be the trend for this movie , the villains are n\'t developed at all . They are clearly `` OMG EVOL ! ! ! 1 ! ! \'\' because they act like , well , normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack . Were they given more depth or a motive at all , I probably would have started to root for them . As it was , I was bored silly . Aesthetically speaking , the film was n\'t terrible , although I could have done with less cool toned lighting . Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious . Also , the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle , supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson . I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain . He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . I would n\'t recommend Twilight to anyone . No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper . ',ironisch

Consequently , Edward is filled with guilt and decides that she needs to lead a normal life without being endangered by their presence every day , and so they all pack up and leave . I nearly choked when I saw that time passes without him . But , try as she might , Bella is empty without him . She realizes that when she is in danger , she can hear his voice in her head ( usually yelling ) , and so she begins to pursue dangerous hobbies just to hear his voice again . One of these hobbies brings her into close friendship with Jacob Black , the Quileute Indian boy who tipped her off to Edward \'s identity in the first book , and he seems to temporarily appease her pain at Edward \'s absence . But Jacob has his own secrets , and Bella is again endangered when a vampire returns to Forks for revenge . I must admit , most of the reason this book kept me up late reading was in hopes of word from Edward . Jacob and his friends were fun , and it * was * exciting to see another facet of the books \' mythology , but almost the whole time Bella was with Jake , I was adamantly pining for Edward . When he does return , I was not disappointed , and Jake \'s involvement also sets up the potential for a powerful love triangle . It was n\'t quite as solid as the first book , but I sense that New Moon is an important transition . Many questions were brought up , like whether vampires have souls , and just how far must Bella and Edward go to stay together ? She wants to become one of them , and Edward insists that she remain human . Now that we \'ve caught wind of it , what exactly is agreed in the treaty the vampires have with the Quileutes ? And what will Bella do now that her boyfriend and her best friend are mortal enemies ? All of this feels like necessary groundwork in order to address these issues in the next book . I enjoyed New Moon immensely , despite Edward \'s absence for most of it , and I \'m eager for the next installment ; I ca n\'t wait to see how Meyer resolves some of these issues , and what ride we will experience in the next book .

1061,19_3_RVCE8OLDQ8Q1T.txt,' This sharply portrayed and picturesque film is no less than a stunning masterpiece ! Finely capturing the gusting momentum of a kingdom and its contending rule , all the while bootying the intricacies of family passion & amp ; strife , this movie grasps all by masterfully portraying it within the frame of a Christmas holiday spent at the beauteous castle of Chinon . The year is 1183 , and Henry II , insatiate King of the British Empire summons forth his family : his wife - Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine , and their surviving sons Richard , Geoffery , and John . They meet at Chinon - and like every gathering of this family must always have been , this meeting is momentous ~ James Goldman wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar he won for this screenplay -- for , not only is it in tune to every orchestral note of this history , but it is also precise as a dagger in its eloquence ~~ I \'ve rarely heard a more masterful script portrayed on film ! Such a prodigious screenplay must needs have a brilliant cast and musical score to give it flesh and blood -- and herein you \'ll find it most heartily delivered ! Katharine Hepburn is absolutely stellar in her portrayal of perhaps one of the most fascinating women in history : the much-acknowledged & quot ; Queen of Love & quot ; throughout Europe before she became Queen of France , fighting in the Crusades alongside her husband Louis VII of France - and then Queen of England , wife of Henry II , who had imprisoned her for many years for joining her sons in plots against him . Henry would free her at times for such holiday family gatherings as this . Hepburn \'s scenes with Peter O\'Toole , as Henry , are pure electrically-charged art ! As King and Queen , parents to the three aspired heirs to the throne , they lay blame and conspire against each other , and their sons will stop at nothing to acquire what they each feel that they deserve : succession to the throne . To add to this tangled web of deceit are the young King Phillip of France and his sister , Alice , who had been raised in the household of King Henry , betrothed to Richard since her infancy . While Eleanor and her sons each plot with the French King , Henry openly exhibits his ongoing love affair with Alice~~ The chemistry of this well-casted drama is flawless - every line spoken a masterpiece of wit and daring .

323,12_15_R1PJXC9IGJ1SGH.txt,' Long time fan of the Lego Games by Traveler \'s Tales . I loved Lego Star Wars , Indy was good . Batman was my favorite . I must confess , I never played Lego Indy 2 . Though , a disclaimer , I do not like the inspirational subject matter of this one near as much as the others , so it was already at a disadvantage . However , this game is so poor that I felt the need to tell everyone . This game is just too buggy and repetitive for me . Perhaps its the subject matter , but the lack of character depth and variety in this one is just disappointing . Just basically the three main guys ( Harry , Ron , and whats her name ) with an occasional other guy . That aside , it might still be a decent title . The huge problem with this one is the finicky controls and bugs ( and I \'m not talking about spiders crawling through the woods ) . The point and shoot interface of the Wii seems to be a little moody , especially when there is a clump of stuff you want to shoot . Once you lock on to one target , though you can add additional targets , you still have to shoot . That means if you accidentally lock on to another Hogwarts classmate , but you wanted to shoot a potted plant , you have to just shoot the classmate . Most of the time this does n\'t matter , however , if they have been shot already , and they are provoked , this makes for an unneeded attack . Also , if you are in a level where the game is counting towards `` True Wizard , \'\' if you shoot a bunch of stuff at once because you are already locked on , you will not have time to grab everything before the studs disappear . The next issue I have with this game is the purple floating spell . On multiple times , this has happened . Sometimes you have to levitate an object , and float it to another spot on the screen . Sometimes , it gets stuck , and you have no choice but to restart the level because you cant even float it out of wherever it is stuck . For example , in the level where Ron and the girl are chasing Dobbie in the Quiddich stadium , there comes a point you have to levitate a heavy ball , and connect it to a hanging rope to cause the gate to go up . Well , if you ( either accidentally or mistakenly ) put the ball into the ladder hole you climbed up on , the ball gets stuck . It is not stuck in a physical sense , because the spell is obviously trying to move it and when your character climbs on it , the ball spins in place , however , you can not attach the ball to the place where it needs to go to advance . Guess what ? You just wasted 10 minutes of your life getting to that point . There is no way to reset the ball . You must just restart the level . This also happened to me on the level where you fight the giant spider at the end . There is a rain cloud near the beginning you must form . I didnt move the rain cloud high enough into the sky , and tried to move it over to the statue . It got stuck , so I had to restart the level , as you can not advance without doing it properly . My next big issue with this game is the save feature . Several times , I have finished levels , watched the outtro video , and turned it off , only to find that I have to replay the level the next time I come back . Why ? Because not only must you watch the end of level cutscene to save it , but you must then either select to go back to the Leaky Cauldron or on to the next level . Then , and only then does the game save your progress . This is counter intuitive to me . When I turn off at the end of a level , I dont want to go to the next chapter OR go to the Leaky Cauldron . I just want to turn it off . But I get to go back and play again . The last gripe I \'ve got is the parts where you have to lift something , spin it , and send it flying again . There are two that come to mind . First , when Harry gets to Ron \'s house and you have to flip the gnomes ( or elves , or whatever ) and then again when you fight the giant spider . This is so confusing and counter intuitive the way this is done , you will die many times ( on the spider , not the gnomes ) before you luck into hitting it 3 times . It is just frustrating . Dont get me wrong , the level layouts are great . The music is great , and the graphics are great . To me , when a game has so many problems , it frustrates you to play it , that means its time to put it down , dust off the old Lego Star Wars or something , and play a game that is not so problematic .

325,27_7_R1I4IUUPD992AP.txt,' ( A tip to other reviewers : Do n\'t rate an item if you do n\'t own it . Some of these reviews are from people who have n\'t even seen this player ! ) This item arrived quickly , on a Saturday to our surprise , via Fedex . It \'s a gorgeous ( if you like simple/shiny black ) piece of AV equipment . At first , we were dismayed by what we thought were little scratches on the top - it was just a piece of protective plastic on it that is removable ; it does have a flawless finish . I do n\'t usually leave reviews even though I buy on Amazon frequently , and I feel a bit guilty giving this rave reviews as I work for a competitor , but they have n\'t come out with a similar product yet . We mostly wanted to upgrade the family room/media room for our teens to give them more reason to hang out home with their friends - I must say , that works . They ca n\'t wait to show off another blu-ray to friends ( who are self-impressed audiophiles for the most part ) who are very impressed . The only problem , is , we want to watch it as much as they do ... we never used to watch TV this much . I know this sounds like an ad but really , it \'s that amazing . The tech stuff : The ease of setup , connection to the TV and the internet is simple and straightforward . One HDMI cable to TV ( included w/TV ) , done . Plug in Ethernet if you do n\'t want to use wireless . It \'s pure digital output - sound and video . It has a separate Digital audio out for those who were worried about the extra HDMI output . The sound is astonishing . Digital sound , ca n\'t beat it . ( We \'re using it with a Philips Soundbar now , but the TV itself has great sound ) . If you do n\'t have a hi-def TV it might not work as well , but then why buy it anyway ? The instruction booklet is good clear English , not written by someone with English as a second-language . The only thing that looks daunting to me is the remote control , but the kids do n\'t seem to have a problem with it . It performs beautifully in video and sound . It uses 1.4 cables ( do n\'t do what we did and buy 1.3 cables , besides the TV comes with cables ) . It runs on wifi to access the internet , and can download Netflix , Pandora , Youtube , etc. , etc. , content , and came with coupons for that . The kids like the internet part ; we use it much less than they do . It works flawlessly with our TV . We own the Samsung UN46C7000 46-Inch 3D HDTV and love it ; together it \'s a marriage made in Home Theater Heaven . It \'s SUPER fast compared to other blu-Rays we have used . This is the first * 3D * blu-ray we have used , and comparing it to regular 2-D blu-rays , it blows them all away . It up-converts beautifully and our 2-D blu-ray videos look like a dream on this . We have only had it for days so we will write more when we have had more movies under our belts , but : older 3d movies look amazing , regular 2-D ( most blu-rays are still ) and downloads . All we can say so far is WOW . If you are interested in upgrading to a new 3D TV in the near future , this is a no-brainer to buy , Movies we suggest to knock your socks off : National Geographic 3D movies , Polar Express , Bugs ! , the IMAX movies , and the new Micheal Jackson movie . Older teens liked the Bloody Valentine movie . The kids - even my son - reverted to movies like Snow White ( the new blu-ray ) to my surprise , just because it was so `` flipping awesome \'\' to watch on this player . WARNING : If you have a hard time pulling yourself away from the TV set ( we never used to like we do now ) - do n\'t buy this . You wo n\'t want to leave the room . If you \'re looking for a top-notch , latest technology Blu-ray player with extras that \'s going to work quickly , this is a good buy . I \'ve blathered on enough ; check it out . ',normal

328,32_1_R24NLQQ739CN43.txt,' I rarely will type/review products but I \'ve been a little frustrated reading the reviews of this product on Amazon and by users at other sites . Many users seem to think that this camera was designed to compete with expensive , professional cameras that cost thousands of dollars and produce full HD quality video . That \'s not what this is . Also , while my camera has n\'t had the \'noise \' issue from the Mic , i have seen a camera that had the issue and its BARELY noticeable . Its almost like a very quiet background noise from a Florescent light or something . Kodak has designed , marketed , and built a camera to compete with FLiP and has clearly produced a FAR better product . I \'ll keep it short and sweet and first explain who I am and what I am using this camera for . I use it for : -Home Videos/Fun stuff with old buddies and friends -For work when I need some quick video that \'s easy to upload online , or put in iMovie and edit -For work when I need more complex videos that may require editing , or somewhat lengthy video but I want the ease of use/portability . I have seen some of the problems stated with the internal Mic and I have had none of them ( I do have the upgraded Firmware that is now standard 1.03 , and Kodak says this completely eliminates the issue ... again have never had the issue on my camera ) . A relative of mine was lucky enough to purchase this product when Kodak did an \'early \' release a few months ago and occasionally his videos will have a bit of a higher pitched background noise , but it does n\'t interfere with the sound from the video -- its just a light background noise that , honestly , i \'ve heard on dozens of cameras . Do n\'t forget , without an external Mic the camera only records mono so -- the sounds quality is n\'t going to be great anyway ! The video is great , image stability is n\'t as advanced as those available on more expensive cameras but it is better than anything i \'ve seen in a FLiP or other Kodak model . It does work and you can see a difference , even if its not huge . Its SO easy to flip between video modes . The 1080p is awesome , but sometimes its nice to move back down to 720 and the 60fps to capture \'action \' footage . One negative -- which most people may see as a positive -- i do wish there were more settings , or at least the ability to play around with more features/edit modes . Its GREAT easy to use , its a point and shoot video camera -- but with the great lens and abilities , it seems like Kodak could have -- pretty easily -- had this camera competing with much higher end cameras . If all the hardware was put to great use this could compete with $ 500+ cameras . But I understand wanting to keep it simple . I like having the SD card . Some people would prefer the internal memory , and yes by the time you buy a decent sized SD card the camera is more expensive than the FLiP , but , the FLiP has a very limited memory . This camera is limited only by the size of the card ... Definitely a positive ! Finally , I know people that are both in the TV business and do a lot of Video blogging and they are drooling over this camera because of the external mic capabilities . One reason lots of \'pros \' did n\'t like FLiP was because of the audio issues . Kodak has solved those , not to mention providing better quality video . Again this is n\'t something to shoot with if your a young film-maker or a die-hard amateur cinematographer . But if you need something cheap to get some great quality video , or need something super easy to use that is really portable .... Take the plunge . And if your considering FLiP -- do n\'t bother ...

330,37_13_R3RZ2CPGFU07WC.txt,' 17 APR 2010 After researching the ` cornucopia \' of compressors on the market and concluding my own specific needs for such , I decided to purchase this compressor . Good call on my part . After following CH instructions on pre-operation setup , this compressor has performed very well . Within the first 24-hours of receiving it , I used it to add air to vehicle and ATV tires to cleaning the air filter and deck on my mower , to blowing off steps prior to painting . While the coiled air hose takes a little time to get accustomed to , I consider it a minor inconvenience . As many have reported , one may consider the noise level extreme . While you can expect noise from any such device , this inconvenience is limited to only when the device is charging . The portability is a nice added bonus . If you must use an extension cord , make sure the cord is properly rated to the amps and watts of the device . Otherwise , circuit breakers can trip and the device will not work as designed . The use of household-type light duty extension cords may lead to electrical shock hazard , increased fire hazard , and damage to your new compressor . When in doubt , consult with a licensed electrician . Overall , I rate the compressor 5 stars . It beats driving to a service station and throwing away [ ... ] for three minutes of air time . Assuming you can find a service station with a working air hose ! Mike [ ... ] ',normal

335,2_10_R3QR3AC2WXWHIT.txt,' Since taking delivery of my pen I have been very happy with the quality of ink deposition on the various types of paper that I have used . On the first day when I excitedly unwrapped my pen ( thanks for the high quality packaging Amazon ! ) I just could n\'t contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on , like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen , the Post-it notes next to the phone , and on my favourite lined A4 pad at the side of my desk . My pen is the transparent type with a blue lid . I selected this one in preference to the orange type because I like to be able to see how much ink I have left so that I can put in another order before I finally run out . When the initial excitement of taking delivery of my new pen started to wear off I realised that I should n\'t just write for the fun of it , this should be a serious enterprise , so by the second day of ownership I started to take a little more care of what I wrote . I used it to sign three letters , and in each case was perfectly happy with the neatness of handwriting that I was able to achieve . I have a helpful tip for you that you might not know about - if you let the ink dry for a few seconds you can avoid the smudging that sometimes happens if you rub the ink immediately after writing . Fortunately the ink used in this particular Bic pen seems to dry very quickly . On the third day of ownership I went on a trip to London and took my pen carefully packed away in my brief case , but I need n\'t have worried , this is n\'t some temperamental ink pen that leaks when you store it at the wrong angle . I sat at my meeting and confidently removed the cap from my pen and it wrote flawlessly , almost immediately . I notice that the barrel of the pen has been crafted very carefully to fit in the pen holder down the edge of my Filofax . It \'s not so grippy so that it is hard to remove when I want to make a quick note , and yet not so loose that it falls out too easily when I open my Filofax in a hurry . Maybe the choice of surface texture on the pen has some part to play here , because it seems that the inside of the leather grip on the pen holder in my Filofax has just the right level of adhesion that I can be confident when I need to reach in and get my pen it \'s going to be just where I left it ! Today is the fourth day of ownership of my pen , and I have to say I \'m starting to treat it like an old friend . I walk around the office with it clipped in to my shirt pocket and someone in the accounts department actually asked to borrow it while we were both standing at the photocopier . Would you believe it , they actually tried to walk away with my pen ! They were very embarrassed when I called after them as they walked down the corridor and asked for it back . You will be happy to know that it is now back , safe and sound in my top pocket , ready and waiting to start writing again . In summary , I would happily recommend this pen to anyone who is planning on writing on paper . If you are considering a writing implement for some other surface such as writing on a CD , or other non-porous substances then another pen might be better suited , but if it \'s just plain old paper then I think you will probably be well served by this particular model .

340,16_4_R2Z5QF7Y4LHPEO.txt,' ... he \'s cute , knows how to bark in tune , and is quite the dancer - and he refuses to lip-sync . After all , they call them `` live performances \'\' for a reason , do n\'t they ? If my last statement sounds ridiculous , it should n\'t . The media has come a long way in the last few decades . There was a time when a person or band really needed to work their way up to become successful , by performing in small clubs for chicken feed , hoping that one day a talent scout would recognize their talent and sign them to a recording deal . But as the great Bob Dylan once said , the times they are a changin \' . The fact is that in this day and age , you do n\'t need any talent whatsoever to become famous - how else to explain the ubiquity of the irrelevant Paris Hilton ? To prove my point , witness the phenomenon known as MTV , which placed the music video medium on a widespread scale . Started in 1981 , it began as an outlet for established acts , but soon came the emergence of disposible pop acts which greatly benefited from the visual exposure that MTV granted them - Milli Vanilli and Britney Spears are but two acts that would have gone nowhere without the network . Second , let \'s look at multifaceted entertainers of years past . It \'s much easier to respect musical artists that cross over to acting ( Elvis Presley , Cher , and Barbra Streisand are examples ) - after all , they had the chops to make it in music and eventually went on to garner respect in acting roles . However , when an actor decides to take a stab at music , it makes the person seem desperate for a buck . The completely tone-deaf Don Johnson , Bruce Willis , and Eddie Murphy made ill-advised recording efforts , but got wise and quickly went back to what they do best . However , there are some exceptions to this rule - Jennifer Lopez is without question a below-average vocalist , but miraculously managed to sell millions of albums . She succeeded during a time where sex appeal was everything , and talent was not a necessity - which also explains the stunning success of lip-syncing flunkies like Spears . This brings me to Lindsay Lohan . Once a clean-cut star of many a Disney film , upon reaching the age of 18 , she has turned herself into a walking Girls Gone Wild show . The success of Spears and Lopez clearly paved the way for Lohan to receive a record deal . Because we all know that if you are attractive and famous for any reason at all , that must mean that you are talented enough to become a recording artist - or so we are to believe . Despite all this , I cast aside all preconceived notions I had before I listened to this album . Now that I have , it \'s safe to assume that A & R people would have laughed hysterically at Lohan if she were an unknown - her debut album Speak is , in a word : abysmal . Modern technology keeps her voice in tune , but it does n\'t help the slick , lifeless arrangements or the incredibly insipid lyrics ( of which I ca n\'t be bothered to print ) . Given the minimal amount of effort spent on this release ( including very few live instruments ) , Lohan might as well have phoned in all of her `` contributions \'\' to this recording . The worst offender of all tracks here has to be `` Rumors \'\' ... pity poor Lohan , who ca n\'t deal with paparazzi following her every move . Honey , if it \'s privacy you \'re looking for , you entered the wrong profession - leave Hollywood , become a coal miner , and I guarantee you that no one will ever bother you again . Problem solved . In summary : Yet another actor who thinks she can sing , Lindsay Lohan put forth a very weak effort that is n\'t worth the disc it \'s printed on . There are far more talented artists out there performing in hotel bars just to make ends meet - by not giving your support to hacks like Lohan , record labels will have to work harder to discover genuine , deserving talent . Definitely pass on this release . ',ironisch

The pens are compact and easy to carry with you ; this makes them easy to carry because they are so lightweight . The pens are made of plastic with a see through ink tube inside them .

Actually , that \'s an accurate description of the film - it \'s jut that the mind-blasting truth is eminently relatable and human . Moon \'s a lot more complicated than it looks . Sam Bell ( Sam Rockwell ) is the sole inhabitant of a moon base dedicated to mining Helium-3 for Lunar Industries . His companion is GERTY ( Kevin Spacey ) , a ceiling-hung robot that expresses itself through emoticons . For three years , Sam has overseen the various mining robots , worked on his wooden models , talked to his plants , and longed to be reunited with his wife Tess ( Dominique McElligott ) and daughter Eve ( Rosie Shaw ) . With his time up , he \'s ready to go home . The catch is that Sam perceives everything through a filtered lens - even his transmissions to Earth are delayed . Sam is n\'t just alone for three months ; he \'s alone without any synchronous human contact . Red herrings abound . It \'s easy to focus on the HAL-like robot GERTY , a major character and foil for Sam . How can you trust something that sounds so benign as Kevin Spacey ?

It \'s a lot like Memento , high praise for a film that cost just $ 5 million to produce . The fun is in watching Sam deal with the truth of his situation and how he rises above it ( or succumbs to it ) . Moon is littered with clues , making it worth another view .

353,11_19_RKKYEBNNEDDR2.txt,' We previously owned a smaller slide from a knock-off company and it finally tore apart after two summers of hard use . Despite the spotty reviews on this one , we bought it for half retail price in the Fall and gave it to our kids ( 4 and 6 ) for Christmas . Oh the pain of having to wait for warm TX weather to use it ! But it was so worth the wait . We have used it several times now with no problems and the kids are THRILLED with it . Here are my tips and observations : Dump a few ounces of tear-free soap at the top of the slide ramp and along the outer edge of the curve . This has many benefits : It helps to prevent fabric burns on knees , elbows , shoulders , etc that come into contact with a dry part during sliding . It makes the slide a bit faster . It creates bubbles in the pool part , which the kids enjoy . It helps to clean the fabric and gives it a nice scent ( instead of mold ) . When the kids are done , drain the pool , grab the top handle of the stair part and flip the whole thing upside down while it \'s running . This allows water to come out of the footholds and the air chambers . ( I \'m not sure why this slide takes water into the air chambers along the bottom , but it does . And for some reason it leaks back out much better upside down . ) Finally , you \'re going to want to allow a couple hours after use to keep it up and running in order for it to dry . Be sure to drag it to a dry spot in the yard so it \'ll dry underneath too . If you fold it up damp at all , it will grow mold . ( They all do that . ) Yes it \'s heavy . It \'s a huge water slide . But I \'m a 5 \' 3 \'\' woman and I can set it up and take it down by myself . In fact , this is the very first inflatable I \'ve ever had that I could actually get to fit in the storage bag provided . It takes some precision folding , but I \'ve gotten that sucker into the bag all by myself every time . My last tip is that this is actually fun to use dry as well . You wo n\'t be able to slide on it , but my kids have spent hours of imaginative play with it in the evenings after school this spring . They pretend it \'s a ship and they sit in the crow \'s nest ( top of the slide ) to look out over the ocean . They throw out anchors in storms and save mermaids and lots of other missions that require endless trips up and down the ramp . Our own backyard theater production . So far no problems with any rips or tears in the seams , and that \'s even with two jack russells that constantly jump onto the lower air chambers , with their sharp little talons . I highly recommend this slide , but it \'s not worth retail price . Find it like we did at half price , no tax and free shipping ... That \'s a deal worth buying . ',normal

355,47_19_R25437GBYT5CH.txt,' Although `` Deep Impact \'\' invariably gets compared to `` Armageddon \'\' , I think it \'s more appropriate to compare it against all other disaster movies . Viewed in that light , it not only surpasses `` Armageddon \'\' , but every other film in the genre . Unlike most disaster epics , `` Deep Impact \'\' is character driven . I think this is a direct effect of its having been directed by a woman rather than a man . While the special effects are there and are impressive , what drives this film are the emotions of the excellent ensemble cast . All of them ring true , from the occasional duplicitousness of the government bureaucrats , to the real tear jerking moments of those facing tough life and death decisions , to the small intimate moments . It \'s powerful enough stuff that I have to believe that a lot of the negative reaction the film elicited vis-a-vis `` Armageddon \'\' came from guys who do n\'t like their action movies to move them to the verge of tears in public . All disaster films depend on a hook to set them up . In this respect , most fall far short of realism and believability . Of ones that come immediately to mind , only the cosmic collision movies and `` The Towering Inferno \'\' had realistic setups . All disaster films depend on the heros to come up with some way to save the day . Of the ones with a believable setup , many still fall short of believable and/or technically accurate resolutions . This is where `` Armageddon \'\' failed miserably . Mimi Leder had expert advice from NASA and it shows . `` Armageddon \'\' has some impressive training facilities shots from NASA , but ignored the actual technology . Very early in `` Armageddon \'\' , when I saw the two shuttles docking with the space station by coming in from opposite directions , performing clearly aerodynamic banking maneuvers , I was ready to start pelting the screen with rotten tomatoes ! Giving the devil his due , both films glossed over the full impact of operations in the microgravity environment of the comet \'s surface . Still , it \'s the raw emotions that elevate `` Deep Impact \'\' above its genre , not just the technical stuff . It \'s actually best in its quiet moments . Among the ones that clearly stand out : The president ( Morgan Freeman ) tries to continue to maintain an upbeat message as each plan successively fails . His press conferences and the dialog around them rings true . The dialog between the reporter ( the usually annoying Tea Leoni ) and her mother ( Vanessa Redgrave ) also rings with truth . The ultimate reconciliation between the reporter and her father ( Maximilian Schell ) just before the end reflects the bitterness of choices each has made in getting to that point . The reunion of the kid who helped discover the comet ( Elijah Wood ) and his girlfriend ( Leelee Sobieski ) , oblivious for the moment to what was going on around them - again , this simply rings true . The astronaut observing wryly , `` Well , the good news is that we \'ll all have high schools named after us . \'\' No melodramatics , no macho heroism , just someone injecting a sense of humor into a shared fate she has accepted as necessary to save the people they love . My favorite line in the film . From start to finish , this film is a class act . A realistic film that carries an emotional impact to be expected of its serious subject matter . Part of this impact is that you ca n\'t always guess in advance which characters will and will not survive . Of the ones who do n\'t survive , not all face their fate gracefully , but all are believable . This movie began my fandom of Mimi Leder , who I consider to be one of the best directors working today - not always commercial , but always excellent . This is on my short list of my top ten favorite movies of all time . Highly recommended ! ',normal

1059,46_12_R2WL4173J0BEJB.txt,' I loved this book . Loved it . I feel that it was very much in synch with Ms. Harris \' earlier works in the series where the cohesion comes from a single mystery that runs like a river under the various plotlines ( some resolved and some to be resolved ) . Also unifying the whole , was the theme of \'family \' which allowed us to get to know our favorite characters on a deeper level -- really nice at this late stage in the series . The character developement overall in this installment was spot on and brilliant ( ie : Taking one of the series \' new characters a full , believable , 180 degrees from sympathetic to psycho ) . Sookie is still our beloved Sookie , her black humor and sass intact , but now with some welcome maturation and self awareness ( Take that Stephanie Plum ! ) and an ability to actually have some empathy and concern for Eric -- oh , and now she will `` stake a b * * * h \'\' if you mess with her or her man ! Speaking of whom , it \'s still our beloved Machiavellian Eric , but now he \'s realizing that he \'s got to be more open and honest if Sookie \'s going to trust him . There \'s a return of the likable Bill for Bill fans . ( Yay old Bill ! Give him a woman he can mollycoddle and talk adorably stilted to for pity \'s sake . ) And even Sam was awesome and cool -- his interactions with Sookie comforting and welcome instead of the yawn fest they \'ve been lately . It was also nice to have Jason back to being Sookie \'s big brother and comic relief rather than the absent ne\'er do well . The author was on her game with her descriptions and dialogue as well . Some favorite quotes that come quickly to mind , `` ... he was not a happy camper . Well , he could pitch his tent right alongside mine . \'\' and `` That looks painful . Would you like me to nurse it ? \'\' ( Honestly , the book deserves 5 stars alone for the `` chair \'\' scene and Pam calling Sookie `` monkey girl \'\' -- too much wicked fun . ) I laughed aloud throughout the book . Finally , there were a few `` True Blood \'\' shoutouts which I really enjoyed ( and I include among these , a flipping of Eric \'s Maker storyline on it \'s head -- way to own it , Ms. Harris , and give us something new along with a sly nod and a wink ) and some clever references to past Sookie short stories -- nice rewards for the faithful fan .

1110,45_12_R2XG4TBT237EDZ.txt,' First off the title of this review may be a little misleading . The handsom Cat Collage t-shirt is n\'t really greater than Success or happiness , because it actually provides both those things . I found this t-shirt in the alley behind the Kmart near my car ( Now most people will say `` your car can be anywhere , it moves dummy \'\' not this car , shes just for sleeping , and pretending to wait for someone in ) . Why anyone would throw this shirt will always be a mystery . I have n\'t taken this shirt off since I found it . There are a few reasons for that . The first is that when I wear it I feel respected . When I walk down the street now large crowds of people seem to part , and they look at me with a kind of controlled fear . I believe this is because of the evil eye the tiger on the right gives anyone with fear or doubt in their hearts . The tiger on left gives stink-eyes to anyone who asks me if i \'m leaving my parking spot . The second reason i have yet to remove this shirt is because i have now set the fashion bar too high . I ca n\'t downgrade . Where am I going to find something as striking and visually pleasing to wear on my laundry day ? The answer is nothing . Short of tatooing this image on my chest there is nothing earthly or celestial origin that can hold a candle to this beautiful fleece of black and blue . It is an understatement to say that this shirt is screen printed with a mixture of assertiveness and courage with a hint of playful instability . Its simply an eyegasm . The third reason i have n\'t taken this shirt off is because it was wet when i first put it on , and due to a sort of full-body trenchfoot i can no longer remove this shirt without a surgical procedure or i risk infection or possibly death . Saying that it is pleasing to the eye is simply an understatement . Look at it . It has 8 of the most beautifully drawn cats in the world on it . It has the type of cluttered variety that most t-shirt artist wo n\'t even attempt . Why would n\'t you want lions AND tigers on your shirt at the same time ? Are you racist or something ? I hope not . I think if 8 consenting cats want to get together on a t-shirt then by golly this is America and they should be allowed to . So big up to the BCC ( Big Cat Collage T-shirt ) .

With no attempt being made to hide her right-wing bias , she is unashamedly blunt about her views , often coating them in biting repartee . It seems that each time Coulter opens her mouth ( or posts another column on her website ) , the mainstream media screams that she \'s `` done it this time ! \'\' Yet her books are bestsellers , and she continues to be published . As she points out , if she \'s so over-the-top , why are people continuing to read her work ? In her sixth book , `` If Democrats Had Any Brains , They \'d Be Republicans , \'\' Ann assembles a collection of her most famous quotes , columns , and interviews on subjects from airport security to taxes , and everything in between . Each chapter contains a brief commentary on the subject , followed by a collection of dated quotes illustrating her beliefs and opinions . I must admit that , in the past , I have stayed away from political non-fiction . As a conservative Republican , I have found much of it to be in disagreement with my personal views on matters , and I like reading as a way to escape the seriousness of my everyday life .

The first thing I noticed as I was unpacking the scanner from the box was a mysterious WARNING about unlocking the lid of the scanner . The scanner was packed with the lid unlocked ( as I found out later ) , and the instructions mentioned to keep the lid locked for travel or extensive handling . Fair enough , but it made me wonder if I had already done something bad to my scanner ( I had n\'t ) . I then installed the software . I expected big things from Canon here , because generally they are pretty smart about software . The software , in terms of use , is much better than the software I had for scanning with my old scanner . The scanner has an `` easy \'\' setting that basically just scans at 300DPI without a fuss . If you want to scan at full resolution , you have to open the `` driver \'\' that exposes a page with all the bells and whistles to let you really fine tune your scan and set the highest resolutions . All this was fair enough , however I found a few minor disturbing problems with the software . Firstly , once you \'ve opened the `` driver \'\' , it \'s not intuitive to figure out how to get back to the `` no brainer \'\' mode . Also , when you want to save your scan , it always seems to default to the scanning library it sets up . If you override it , it does n\'t stay `` changed \'\' . This is a slight pain . I always wonder who they hire to test and give feedback , because I always feel like I \'m pointing out what should be the `` obvious \'\' to large companies like Canon ( actually I really love Canon - so take no offense ! ) . As far as scanning speed is concerned , the scanner does indeed scan a 300 dpi page in about 11 seconds ( that \'s pretty fast folks ) . However , the estimate does not include the 3 seconds the software takes to respond to the command to begin scanning ( I \'m running a duo core processor - no slouch ) and the few seconds it takes to save the image . All in all , speed is impressive . Now on to document quality . I tried scanning a few brochures and to be honest , at 300 DPI I was n\'t super impressed with the result . So I went into the `` driver \'\' at set the scanning at maximum resolution ( 4800 x 4800 ) . You get a pretty good result at that resolution , but by no means was I blown away . Perhaps more `` tweaks \'\' of the driver is needed . I noticed that the scanner attempts to `` improve \'\' the picture ( which it does ) but some of the detail of the text was a little off ( brochure had images and text ) . I wondered if the lid of the scanner was making really good contact . Next time I will add a few pages of plain white paper behind the image and see if it makes a difference . I tried scanning a printed document , and compared it to a printed document I scanned using my old scanner . I scanned the image to a PDF and low and behold , a major , major improvement ( at 300 DPI ) . So , I gave the scanner four `` stars \'\' . Why not five ? Well , the software is much easier to use than my old scanner , but still not without a few minor `` quirks \'\' . This is a great scanner for scanning documents . How well it will actually scan and reproduce a photo is still in question , and perhaps I need to learn how to use the driver software better . I do n\'t think I could scan an original photo without seeing some degradation in quality . I \'d be interested to hear other people \'s experiences regarding copying photos . I hope I \'m wrong in my assessment , because I really expected a 4800x4800 scanner to reproduce `` dead on \'\' copies of a photo . ',normal
380,35_8_R16DNO7RN9UUKR.txt,' Wow this tool is great . If you want a great tool for survival this is it . It is very sturdy and strong . The knife could be a little sharper than what it comes as but it is still sharp enough to cut paper . The razor at the top of the blade is very sharp as well . I bought this tool to be stored in my vehicle , I drive many miles every day and my worse nightmare is to witness a car accident and not be able to help the people involved . This tool is a sharp edge , a serrated edge , a seat belt cutter , a very effective pry bar ( its greatest feature ) and the right angle at the end of the tool can easily break a window with no problem . The sheath that is comes with is absolutely exquisite , I own many knives and this is the best sheath I have for any knife . Another great benefit to this knife is the fact that the handles can be easily removed for maintenance . You can definitely see that this knife is built to last a lifetime of abuse . I think this knife would be best suited for firefighters and police officers or maybe , like myself , the average joe that needs to be able to help when called upon . Like I said before this tool would be very good for camping and outdoor use , you can chop wood or skin an animal . I think of the lack of a point as a plus because it makes for a stronger tool , there \'s no tip to break off ! Buy it , you will show it off to everyone and they are going to want one too !

381,26_19_ROI942EK5WT00.txt,' `` Brooklyn \'s Finest \'\' is a remarkably entertaining and well-acted police drama from director Antoine Fuqua , who also directed the also outstanding police drama , `` Training Day . \'\' The film focuses on three very different Brooklyn cops over the course of a week . Richard Gere plays Eddie , a hardened veteran just a week away from retirement . He has nightmares , he \'s separated from his wife , and he \'s just biding his time until his retirement . Ethan Hawke , the hero of `` Training Day , plays a narcotics detective desperate to finance a new home to give a better life to his wife , children , and twins on the way . Don Cheadle plays Tango , an undercover cop , who is so deep undercover that he forgets who he really is , and to make matters worse , he now has to setup a high-level drug dealer who saved his life while he was undercover in prison . These examples of Brooklyn \'s Finest are all living on the edge , and they all go over the edge one way or another . The acting from these three is superb . Their performances along with Wesley Snipes as the drug dealer , Brian F. O\'Byrne as Hawkes \' best friend and partner , Shannon Kane as Eddie \'s hooker with a heart of gold , and a number of others , make this a very enjoyable , but powerfully sad and tragic film .

1019,18_3_R1GWYJUM73ISLN.txt,' I got my DSi when I traded in my DSlite . So , considering that I paid well under $ 100 , I am very happy with it . I like the built in sound and photo manipulators . The kids and I have had a blast with them . The larger screen does n\'t make a huge difference but it does look really nice . I was really sold by the downloadable content , browser ( though not used much ) , cameras and the sd slot . Awesome features . I also like the improved volume control as it was very hard to fine tune the volume on my DS lite . I think its a real shame that they did n\'t include a GBA slot on this one , though it clearly was n\'t a deal breaker . The only other negative is that I \'m not crazy about the matte finish . That \'s simply a matter of taste , however . If they had left the GBA slot intact I would have given the DSi the fifth star . ',normal
1232,19_8_R3BCMWGJPVQ9K.txt,' Here is a book that either changed people \'s lives or irritated the bejesus out of them . Count me among the latter . Eat Pray Love - One Woman \'s Search for Everything Across Italy , India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert was supposed to enlighten me . It did n\'t . OK -- First the positive : Overall , it is a well-written book . The author takes many complicated metaphysical concepts and makes them readable . The book is divided into sections : Eat , which is the author \'s journey to Italy ; Pray , her pilgrimage to India and Love , where she takes a lover in Bali . This is about a thirty-something woman looking for spirituality and happiness . She is married , but desperately unhappy for no single reason that she can not or will not divulge . So , she leaves her husband ( and , by the way , gives him all marital property out of supposed `` guilt \'\' for leaving him , making me wonder what exactly she did to warrant this ) and falls right into another relationship ( a-ha ! adultery , perhaps ? ) . When the rebound relationship that broke up her marriage falls apart , she now wants to find God . Of course . She claims God spoke to her on the bathroom floor , thus beginning her journey . But not before she goes to her publisher and secures a $ 200,000 advance for this book . Makes you wonder , as one reviewer on Amazon pointed out , was the journey retrofitted to the book proposal ? What better way to go find God than in Italy . For four months she eats gelato , practices her Italian with a young man named Luca Spaghetti ( If you are going to make up names of allegedly real people , could you find a more sterotypical name ? Why not Carmine OrganGrinder ? ) and gains 23 pounds -- quick to point out to the readers that she was way underweight to beign with . She learns to enjoy life and be selfish from the Italians - who by the way still find her immensely attractive , although they do n\'t hoot and holler at her like they did 10 years previously . But she is still so damned cute . Just ask her . On to India . At the Ashram , she learns to meditate and still broods over her lost marriage and subsequent realtionship . Probably the most boring part of the book , except for her conversations with `` Richard from Texas \'\' -- a down home , larger than life character who speaks in folksy platitudes that would make Andy Griffith proud . He also bestows our author with her nickname `` Groceries \'\' because she was emaciated from grief from crying for the millionth time over her beloved David . As one reviewer from Amazon said , `` What kind of nickname is Groceries ? \'\' I honestly believe she made these people up . Reminds me of `` Go Ask Alice \'\' -- supposedly the real story of the drug-addicted Anonymous -- until it was revealed that the protagonist was a fictitious composite of the author \'s psychiatric patients . Boo . Then Bali . She ends her self-imposed celibacy with an older Brazilian man . High on orgasmic ecstasy , out of the supposed goodness of her heart , she asks her friends to send $ 18K in donations to help a single mother , an alleged friend of Ms. Gilbert \'s , who is portrayed as a con artist because she did n\'t buy a house in the timeframe coinciding with the termination of Ms. Gilbert \'s visa . I always thought that a gift should be a gift without strings attached -- especially coming from someone who supposedly found God . I wanted to ask Ms. Gilbert `` What Would Jesus Do ? \'\' My biggest problem with this tome is that this 30-something woman basically is looking for applause for running off for a year , obstensibly supported by a $ 200K book advance , to `` find God . \'\' I \'m sure millions of women would love to leave their everyday lives and travel the world to do nothing but self analyze . If she had done volunteer work , I may have felt differently . If she went through some real hardship , I could sympathize . But she was in an incompatible marriage , then dumped by the guy she left her husband for . She should perhaps speak to those battling life-threatening diseases , or raising children alone , or taking care of an elderly parent , or worried about where their next meal is coming from . And for all of her self-realization and navel-gazing to end her dependence on men , Ms Gilbert has , as pointed out by anotherAmazon reviewer , married her Brazilian and moved to new Jersey . She could have saved Penguin Books a whole lot of money by getting in her car and going through the Lincoln Tunnel . I wonder how long before she ends up back on the bathroom floor . ',ironisch
384,5_9_REOX5991UD9N.txt,' Well Despite all the reviews , I decided to order the Archos 5 160GB version . I was a little worried about what I would encounter , however there worries would soon transition from worried to eased . The make of this device is very solid and it is a little big for the pocket , but it \'s manageable . This device would be significantly useful for people on the go as it allows you to bring a large amount of media with you all in a neat little tablet that can handle HD output ( Given some videos are going to be laggy , but this is normal for most hand held devices as they do not have the rendering capabilities that of a computer does ) . However to deal with this , Archos is trying to maintain regular updates . Just recently they released 2 updates for the Archos 5 . If you go to the main Archos site , which is at [ ... ] you can look at the updates that have been released for the device . It turns out that with each update they are trying to clean up the HD output given the limitations of the hardware also they are working on another update which is called doughnut , which is version 1.6 android , I believe ( which will hopefully include the android market ! ! : ) ) . This device also has a TON of space . With all this space it can have other uses as well . I , Personally , have a large collection of books and music , I used this device as a backup of all my files so that in the event that anything happens to my main machine , I will always have the files I prioritized . Another neat little thing that the Archos 5 can do is it can read PDFs and Office Files , which is nice if you ever have to edit your office files on the go . With the amount of area that is displayed by the screen , it allows for a very nice and ease of reading . At times I can find myself reading a book on it and reading it with ease with the large screen , as well as the capabilities of the software to handle PDFs . One thing to be noted by this is the fact that due to the hardware constraint , it will have to load each page after you read about half of your current page and half of the next page in order to have it load the next page . This is done to save space and maintain its longevity due to its hardware constraints . However , the transitions is very fast , should n\'t be a pain , although a very minor annoyance . One thing I should note is that some people have claimed that some videos are not able to play , although I have yet to encounter this issue . I feel that I got a huge bargain on this device . Given its updates and overall capabilities as not only an internet tablet but also its media playback along with its touchscreen capabilities ( which is acceptable , in practicality -- Make sure that you configure the touchscreen when it seems to not be functioning properly ) it almost feels like a steal . To sum up the review I \'m going to make a list of pros and cons . Pros Large beautiful screen Touch Screen Variety of Media playback capabilities Made with Android OS ( very stable ) Can be used as a PDF Reader as well as do MORE Has GPS capabilities Lots of applications -- AppsLib ( And much more will come when android market is finally released -- although there is a way to get market on it with a little trick -- but it does not include all the times that are in the CURRENT market , its a makeshift to get it to work AND Google applications be installed using this little trick , Google `` Android Market on Archos 5 Internet Tablet \'\' ) Lasts a good amount of time Easy to use -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Cons No android 2.0 ( yet .. ? ) Charging is somewhat slow ( it will lose charge [ when plugged in via DC-IN USB to MiniUSB ] when transferring files to it , do it in chunks to deal with this issue , although you \'ll still lose battery life ) Somewhat laggy Video playback ( should be remedied somewhat with updates ) Locks up sometimes ( this was in the past , however with the new update they released I have n\'t seen it happen .. yet ? ) LONG start up time ( use standby ) I hope this review helps you guys decide on buying one : ) ',normal
1124,44_2_R346THH403TN26.txt,' I was given the Three Wolf Moon shirt as a gift for my departure from my current job assignment . Immediately upon donning the shirt , I was attacked by mobs of women at the pub . My wife was actually trampled to death by the sudden rush of women . Fortunately , the 3 wolves soothed my grief . . . and taught me to fly . After taking a quick aerial cruise around England , I returned to my compatriots . It was a difficult landing , due largely in part to the throngs of women in waiting . After using my laser vision to clear an LZ , I regained my Earthly contact ( if you can call constant hovering `` contact \'\' ) . The Ancient Egyptians believed that the difference between a king and a pharaoh was that pharaohs were actually gods on Earth . After placing the shirt upon my body , I was aware of the state of reverence in which pharaohs were held . This was due in large part to the fact that all about me ( approx . 300 people/worshippers ) were laying prostrate before my holy visage . King Tut has nothing on me thanks to Three Wolf Moon . I did notice a minor drawback to Three Wolf Moon . It involved the inability to make things explode with my mind . I felt it was a basic application of The Shirt . Apparently , I bought a knockoff because my friend purchased Three Wolf Moon and was instantly able to blow up the head of the guy who was sleeping with his girlfriend . I wanted to use it to destroy Fenway Park and allow Wrigley Field to be the sole historical ballpark , but apparently I purchased The Shirt from a different supplier than Pocahontas . ',ironisch

This is the story of a little-known British anti-Nazi espionage plan to divert attention from D-Day in Sicily . There has been brief mention of this tale in several books concerning the British spy systems during WWII , But never before have all of the actual real-life details been revealed . If you enjoy reading of the derring-do exploits of some during war time , this is the book for you . If you are interested in the history of WWII , this is the book for you , if you enjoy spy stories- this will suit you to a `` T \'\' . The tale begins inauspiciously enough with the combination of a poor Welsh laborer and aristocratic MI5 officers , it proceeds through a poor Spanish fisherman and the halls of power in Germany to Hitler \'s desk ! The results of all of this chicanery are astonishing , resulting in a triumph for the Allied forces that leads to a successful invasion of Italy . This tale encompasses stolen bodies , massive cover-ups by the British government , a veritable warren of European spies , and a submarine . The book is well written and consuming , the type of book that one reads in 1 day , because one can not bear to put it down until all plot twists are revealed . The review copy did not have many illustrations , but I would imagine that the final book itself will be well-provided with images of the protagonists , does n\'t matter- the book grips you with vivid descriptions and thumbnail sketches of it \'s own .

I \'ll start by saying that you \'ll see my `` Verified Amazon Purchase \'\' on the Flip HD Ultra Camcorder review because , obviously , that \'s the one I wound up buying and I \'ll share with you why . But what I like in a camcorder may not suit your own needs so I \'ll break it down and let you decide what \'s best for you via what I found out : Here are the pocket camcorders I compared : Flip UltraHD ( will be referred to as `` F \'\' ) Flip Mino HD 2nd generation ( Will be referred to as `` M \'\' ) Creative Labs Vado HD 8 GB 2nd generation ( Will be referred to as `` CL \'\' ) Kodak Zi6 Pocket HD ( Will be referred to as `` K \'\' ) Why HD cameras only ? Brighter colors and better images , wider images HD SHOOTING TIME : F : 120 minutes . M : 120 minutes CL:120 minutes K : 25 minutes with batteries they included , 120 minutes if you buy an SD card MEMORY : F : 8 GB M:8 GB CL : 8 GB K : internally only 30 MB recording space but it has 32 GB expandable SD/SDHC card slot . Because it comes with such small recording space you really need to buy an SD or SDHC card to maximize its potential , but the potential is really good and this will increase your ability to shoot longer . RESOLUTION : All 720p which is excellent , just one step below the top 1080p format . MICROPHONE : F : Stereo M : Mono * * Update * * They are now putting Stereo Mics in the Minos as of 2010 . CL : Mono K : Mono SOUND : F : Premier AAC audio . Best stereo sound quality but still not great in winds M : Good sound quality . Still not good in winds . CL : Poor sound quality ; had issues with sound and picture not being in sync . K : Poor sound quality ZOOM : F : 2x M:2x CL:2x K : poor quality zoom on the one I tried but I still think it \'s 2x .

M : 30 frames per second CL : 30 frames per second K : choice of 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second . VIEWING SCREEN : All 2 \'\' except the Kodak was the largest at 2.4 \'\' IMPORTANT NOTES : F : Best low-light performance for the mini cameras ( though not perfect at all ) and least amount of blurring and dropped frames in my opinion . Best color . Only one with stereo sound . You can get an underwater case for this one ! Though that may sound crazy for a Texan , we use the camera non-stop on vacations and even when we are n\'t IN the water , we are around the water ... on boats , in the sand with sea mist , etc . Then we can dive in and record the fish . Comes preloaded with flipshare software ... just plug in to computer and it pops up . Only one with stereo sound . M : Colors do n\'t appear as good on the Mino as the other cameras . Thinnest camera . Make sure you get the one that only comes in the color aluminum or brushed metal . If it comes in any other colors it is the 1st generation MinoHD and they improved upon that one in the newer models . Great audio . Better shooting in low light than most mini cameras . Camera comes preloaded with FlipShare software . Can get still images through flipshare software . CL : Decent filming in low light but not nearly as good as the Ultra or Mino ; Software is preloaded in camcorder . K : This is the only camera that I compared without the built in image stabilizatin which corrects for shaky images . What appears to be metal in picture is actually a chrome colored plastic . That said , this had the largest viewing screen of all of them . 2.4 \'\' Very poor in low light and seemed to have far more shaking and blurring . It also takes still pictures but they are really really poor quality ... same as a lesser-quality cell phone pictures but good in a pinch if you want a still shot and have no cell or camera I s\'pose . Heaviest for a pocket camera . Software is not preloaded in camcorder but a cd comes with it . HOW CNET \'S EDITORS RATED THE CAMERAS : F Excellent M Excellent CL Very Good K Very Good And , finally , the reviews of the Flip from experts swayed me quite a bit : Fast Company : `` Flip Ultra HD is Pure Digital \'s `` Best Pocket Camcorder Yet . \'\' 6-09 USA Today : `` New Flip Ultra Video Cameras Might Flip Your Switch \'\' 4-09 Business Week : How do you Invigorate a Recession ? Look to i-phone , Flip , Kindle , and Zip Car For Answers There were lootttts more I came across when researching the Flip Ultra HD but those are some of my favorites . CONCLUSION : Clearest picture and sound was important to me , expert reviews that pointed to the Flip UltraHD as well and I liked the built in software and the case I can get to shoot underwater . It is the number one selling camcorder as well . So that was my personal decision-making process .

397,15_5_R3NO1KOXXC8H5X.txt,' When Michael Jackson died on June 25th 2009 it seems a part of the world died with him . It made many people sad all over the world and it seems that for once everyone was being nice to this man who had always been abused by the Medias ; journalists , interviewers and others . When I heard of the `` This Is It \'\' movie concert I did n\'t know what to think . I knew it was rehearsal footage from the 50 concerts he was to perform at the O2 arena but I did n\'t know what was going to come out of it or what they were going to do with it . When I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this and that `` This Is It \'\' was going to be something special like I \'ve never seen . And that \'s precisely what I got , I even bought my ticket in advance for the movie and feel like it was much worth it . It amazed me how good MJ still was , the dance moves were great and fascinating to me . He was clearly the one in charge of the whole thing . He gave precise instructions of what he wanted , made sure everything was right and did everything that needed to be done . The film shows just how much Michael was respected , there were parts of it where they asked him if he wanted anything or what he thought and if he liked something , it seems no one assumed anything at all . When he talked the crew would listen and he asked things in the nicest way , never to hurt anyone . There \'s not a part that does n\'t make him look like the nice guy he always was . There are mixed feelings about him after all the bad things that have been said about him but after watching this I do n\'t know one could possibly believe them . To be honest I loved every minute of it , every song was special and was great to watch . Right from the beginning of `` Wan na Be Startin\'Somethin \' \'\' it was amazing . No matter how many people surround him he \'s always the one who does things better than anyone else and the one you \'re watching . This Is It was really a unique experience , I felt they chose the right footage parts for the movie and made him look great in every sense . They could truly have messed things up but they did n\'t and came out with an amazing documentary , it \'s sort of a testament to his fans , it \'s just very special . I really liked the Thriller 3D part , it was a 3D video shoot and afterwards you see MJ coming out onstage from a spider , the show would have looked awesome . They Do n\'t Care About Us was amazing , The Smooth Criminal part was very interesting , so was the Earth Song which had a beautiful video of a little girl in a forest , waking up to see that all of it has been destroyed . I wo n\'t go further but every song had something about them . The stage show would have been grandiose , the fireworks , the `` fireball \'\' ( quite impressive I wo n\'t spoil anything ) , pyrotechnics , the videos that accompany the songs are all very impressive . This could very well have been the best show ever had he lived to perform them . In the end I was quite amazed by the 1 : 48 minutes I watched , I ca n\'t wait to see it again and the message Michael gives at the end is very inspiring . From the auditions of the brilliant performers to the credits with the `` This Is It \'\' song I was captivated . The said special features will feature more of the rehearsal and a two part documentary on Michael \'s history and his comeback along behind the scenes . I ca n\'t wait to see more of the rehearsal and hopefully the extras will be great and there will plenty to watch . It \'s hard for me to describe what watching this movie was like and what I felt about it . I know this is rehearsal footage but it \'s truly brilliant and while it main not catch Michael at his best it certainly catches him at his most honest . I do n\'t have anything bad to say about either this movie or the man himself , This Is It is a must see . It does n\'t matter if you watch in its theatrical run or on DVD/Blue Ray when released , this is amazing and his fans just have to see this . I will certainly be amongst those who buy it and watch it over and over again . This man gave his life to music and his fans and I do n\'t remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said : `` He was a gift of god , he was a kind human being who \'s been mistreated by many opportunists , he \'s been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone \'\' or sometime like that . These words are very truthful and really mean something to his fans . ',normal

The first exercise I did was bench press , I was immediately impressed by how great the machine made my muscles contract . My arms shook a lot in the beginning probably because I was not used to doing bench press without a bar , but I got down to the rhythm of it in just a few repetitions . After using the machine and getting an amazing ab workout , I woke up this morning feeling like a truck hit me ... which is exactly how I like to feel the morning after a good workout ! Sore is a good sign that the machine works ! My max on bench press is 275 pounds and 285 on decline , so for a machine that has a max weight of 210 pounds to give me a great workout is just what I was looking for . I would recommend this machine to anyone because 1 . ) The price you can not beat with free shipping and no tax 2 . ) It works your body just like free weights do 3 . ) You will probably spend the same amount that you pay for this thing over a two year period with a gym that does not belong to you at all 4 . ) MOST IMPORTANTLY ! ! !

405,36_8_R2UOCVG31BV4H3.txt,' Out of the big 4 thrash bands of the 80s , Megadeth has always been my favourite . Theyve had a great array of awesome albums , slightly altering their sound in the 90s but not as much as some ( Ahem Metallica ) . Their last Greatest Hits release Capitol Punishments was a big disapointment though , mainly containing 90s singles and also 15 tracks including 2 new ones is not enough for a complete Best Of collection . So I had hopes for this one , being fan chosen to deal the goods . In some ways it does but its still lacking some essential songs . The album is presented in a completely random order but it probably is better then Capital Punishments newest to oldest tracklisting . Again there is more songs chosen from the 90s albums , being there is more of them but this still disapoints me . Only one song Mechanix from KIMB and only one from SFSGSW which definatly needed at least one more . Wheres Mary Jane or even Anarchy in the UK ? Peace Sells gets one more song ( Wake Up Dead ) then it did on Capital Punishment which is pretty good but RIP has exactly the same as it had on Capital Punishment . I definatly would have included one more from that , it is widely regarded as their best album . Countdown to Extinction recieves 3 songs , Skin O \' My Teeth which wasnt included on Capital Punishment but for the life of me i cant figure out why they chose this song over Ashes In Your Mouth which as well as being a far superior song recieved more votes on the [ ... ] forums . But I guess final decision goes . Youthanasia recieves the 2 hits good songs but they dont measure up to Countdown to Extinction . Its great Angry Again was included from the out of print Hidden Treasures . From Cryptic Writings , Trust and She-Wolf . Trust was a big hit and She-Wolf was a fan favourite so its great to see it on here . Risk , the album where they apparently sold out recieves one favourite , Prince of Darkness which is a much better song then the Industrial flavoured Crush Em \' that was on Capital Punishment . Next up is Kill the King , one of Mustaines favourites so we all knew it would be included although im not too pleased about it as it was the bonus track on Capital Punishment and not really needed here . Good song though . Then Dread and the Fugitive song , the only song included off The World Needs a Hero . Would have liked to see another song from that album on here because this was included on Capital Punishment as a bonus track as well . And thats where it ends . Yes nothing off The System Has Failed which is by far their best album since Youthanasia . I dont know what Mustaine was thinking but its obivous a 2cd package was needed to fully display all that Megadeth could be . Wheres Tornado of Souls , Devils Island , Maybe some live tracks or other classic Deth ? Kick the Chair , Blackmail the Universe , Die Dead Enough or any song from The System Has Failed ? The bonus DVD is all well and good but its pretty much just an extended teaser for the upcoming Arsenal Of Megadeth DVD . Its still a very good hits compilation if you want to get into megadeth or if you are a Megadeth completest but for your average fan its not really worth it . I would personally just skip any Greatest Hits CD and go straight to the studio albums , which is where the magic really happens . ',normal

Her characters are wonderful , & quot ; real & quot ; people with strengths and flaws , and I really grew to adore them . Despite skipping around time at the same rate as Henry , the time traveler , the events are sequenced in such a way that you still witness each character \'s growth as a person , as well as discover many surprises along the way . Clare and Henry \'s story is one of the best love stories I \'ve read in a very long time .

When I saw this little gizmo on TV , I was skeptical at first , but I decided to give it a try through Amazon , being nervous about the high pressure I might get from the direct TV phone number . I have used Neckline Slimmer now for five weeks , and I am amazed and happy with the results . First of all , I and others have noticed a clear difference in my double chin . This past week , at least three people asked me if I had lost weight , and the truth is , I \'ve lost none , but my chinline is firmer ! Moreover , a positive side effect that I did not expect is a very tangible strengthening of my neck muscles . This aspect is noteworthy and has helped me improve my posture and overall comfort . So , I have gained confidence and muscle tone . I plan on using this apparatus for the rest of my life , and will give it as gifts to others , especially those with neck problems . My advice : use the Neck Slimmer as suggested . Do n\'t overdo it or your neck might get sore . Do the full routine while sitting in the correct posture . Do n\'t go too fast to the strongest coil ; rather , use the coil that feels most comfortable , and work your way up . ( I have not even started using the strongest coil yet , so my great results come from the middle strength coil . ) My guess is that the poor results described in the other comments come either from expecting too much too fast , or by mis-using the apparatus .

409,30_15_R2QJTDD9O4KM9B.txt,' In 2007 , operatives working out of the Vice-president of the United States \' office were informed that there were ninety-two missing videotapes . Those tapes documented the extreme torture of ghost detainees , individuals captured and whisked away to secret prisons , people who simply disappeared . Waterboarding , while documented on the tapes , was not the worst thing that happened to the ghost detainees . Ulrich , the lead operative , crafts a plausible story to spin to the media , which allows everyone else to sigh in relief . Two years later , someone surfaces , contacts one of the operatives , and tells him that he is in possession of the ninety-two videotapes . He will release them to the world \'s media in five days if he is not paid $ 100 million in small , uncut diamonds . In a Manila jail , Ben Treven is awaiting his fate for the killing of an Australian sailor . Ben was a member of an elite squad of men who `` fixed \'\' problems . He was hand picked for the squad because of his skills in stealth , observation and tactics , and use of deadly force . Waiting out his days , he is visited by his old commander , Colonel `` Hort \'\' Horton , who has a proposition ; find and detain the person that is blackmailing the United States government . There are not many clues , however Hort believes that a dead man has the tapes , a person who died in an explosion in Pakistan in 2007 . Treven wants out of the jail , but he also wants a measure of revenge from Hort , who tried to kill him , his brother , and a female lawyer when an advanced encryption software program was being readied for market . Treven accepts the offer . It is n\'t long until Ben discovers that he is n\'t the only person looking for the tapes or the blackmailer ; the FBI and CIA are on the case as well . The CIA is willing to kill in order to recover the tapes . Ben \'s unique skills as a military assassin will be tested if he is to be the first to the finish line . Barry Eisler has published another excellent novel that focuses on a character , Ben Treven , whom he introduced in his 2009 novel , Fault Line . Inside Out propels Ben to the forefront ; you learn more about him , his training , his background , and the skills that make him so effective and deadly . Should you be unfamiliar with Fault Line , do not worry , Eisler provides a few references , but they are not necessary to the story line of Inside Out . What you will become familiar with in this novel are some of the darkest secrets of government . While Eisler has crafted an excellent thriller , it is n\'t until you reach the Sources and Bibliography that you realize that he has scripted a fictional account of real events . That is not all , however . Eisler works some other ideas into the novel , ones that will make you reconsider what you think you hear , what you think you know . For a work of fiction , it is startling in its depth of research , as presented by the bibliography . Further , Eisler worked another of his characters , John Rain , into Inside Out , which bodes well for regular readers of his novels . The future is bright for Eisler \'s fans and those that like thrilling action , well defined characterization , believable dialog , and thought provoking story lines .

I apologized because I had none to give him , and he handed me this cd . `` Take this , \'\' he said in his grizzled wino voice . `` I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it . \'\' So I brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while I was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress , Angela Adams . I wish I had not put it in the cd player , because the music that came out was really not that good .

Not only is the 98 Degrees music boring , but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues . 1 . The font which is used to write the words `` And Rising \'\' is an unfortunate choice . The components of the `` d \'\' in `` and \'\' are not joined as tightly as they might be , so the `` d \'\' looks like an `` al . \'\' This changes the name of the album significantly . 2 .

In fact , 98 Degrees the temperature is not that hot , just like 98 Degrees the performing group . 3 . Several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band \'s name on their arms .

Those are : * Giving time * Giving things * Giving skills * Giving `` gifts of reconciliation and new beginnings \'\' ( citing everything from the efforts of Nelson Mandela to PeacePlayers International , a group that sets up basketball leagues in the Middle East ) * Giving gifts that keep on giving ( such as the work of Heifer International , which gives millions of poor farmers free cows -- as long as they agree to donate one its first offspring to someone else ) * Giving to good ideas Clinton also includes descriptions of some successful charitable programs that are easy to use as model strategies for your own ideas , illustrates how businesses can make money out of acting in the public interest , and explains his views on what roles governments ( not just Washington , but cities and states ) can play . In the last chapter , titled `` How Much Should You Give and Why , \'\' he argues that if the rich would donate five percent of their incomes to humanitarian causes , the rest of society would give even more , and that one reason to be generous and public spirited is simply that it makes you feel good . `` Who \'s happier ? \'\' he writes . `` The uniters or the dividers ? The builders or the breakers ? The givers or the takers ? I think you know the answer . \'\' Regardless of your political views , if you \'re a charitable person and seriously want to make a difference in the world , this is a must-read . You \'ll come away from it not only inspired , but with plenty of ideas on how to accomplish your goals . ',normal

422,50_12_R24XCD6S26ID9C.txt,' I \'ve read several reviews from people who have wished that their Three Wolf Moon shirts had more wolves . It makes sense , right ? The more wolves , the better . Yeah , and why do n\'t you paint more angels on The Sistene Chapel , and correct the Mona Lisa \'s smile ? While you \'re at it , maybe you could add a few tracks to Sgt . Pepper , and make the Great Wall even greater by adding a Starbucks and a Cinnabon . People , it \'s not like some art school dropout with an airbrush just pulled this design out of his . . . bag of tricks . No . There are three wolves and one moon for a reason . Do n\'t believe me ? Let this be a cautionary tale . Two months ago I had the guy at Shirts Ahoy at the mall press on eleven more wolves . ( Two more above the moon ; one on each sleeve ; six on the back , all howling . ) Walking out of the store , I could feel the heat from my freshly pressed wolves , and I figured I was about to have the best day of my life and I should probably buy a lottery ticket . But my first hint that something was not quite right was when I passed three girls in skirts standing in front of Urban Outfitters , and I did not hear the familiar , gentle thud of panties hitting the floor . I figured they must be lesbians and continued to the parking lot . Driving to work , I observed that the other vehicles did n\'t move out of the way for me , and lights did not automatically turn green as I approached . Very strange . When I got to work , there was actually a pile of unpleasant paperwork where there is normally a giant pile of cash . As I sat at my desk , I began to get a headache and feel hunger , something that had n\'t happened to me since I first donned the TWM . I asked a female coworker to help me peel off the eleven new wolves , but she refused and said she was taking back her recent offer to fulfill my every fantasy . So I did it myself . First I removed the six on back , then the two on the sleeves , then I put the shirt back on and removed the three above the moon . When I peeled off the final wolf , the coworker came back in , replaced my paperwork with a Wii , and told me she was reinstating her offer . I then heard a very familiar , gentle thud . I may not understand the power of the lupine trinity . But hell , I do n\'t understand electricity , or why the sky is blue . But I do n\'t need to understand it ; I only need to respect it . I will never mess with my TWM shirt again . I \'m even careful when I bend over so I do n\'t add an extra moon , if you know what I mean . ',ironisch
423,29_15_R5FRO0OCANCQZ.txt,' I have been a long time user of the Gillette Manual Fusion Razor then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW ... this razor is by far the best razor out there today , no doubt about it ... This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face , nick or cut you in any way ... it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an `` old-school \'\' barber and getting a straight razor shave .. Yes , the blades are expensive but you really do `` Get What You Pay For \'\' so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks .. if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you ... I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving and it does provide a closer shave than a manual razor .. Also , get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush ( Truefitt & Hill , Proraso , etc ) and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life .. A+++ razor that I will continue to use no matter the cost of the blades ... Face it , us dudes have to shave daily ( or almost daily ) so why go cheap and tear up your face if you do not have to ..

Of course , those of us who know something about audio know that aside from a few rare exceptions ( like Magnepan planar speakers which really require a super-quick musical subwoofer ) there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH THING as `` subwoofer-matching \'\' -- -just get the best-sounding sub you can afford . The best bang-for-your buck subs are made by the two dominant Internet-direct subwoofer specialists , Hsu and SVS . This PSW10 is a prime example .

I have a cat and a dog , and there is lots of shedding hair , all the time . Our house is mostly hard floors , stairs , and one large rug in the living room . When I saw the DC25 Animal , I decided to spend the money hoping that this vacuum would do the job .

Not my kind of book . \'\' Finally , this 29-year-old mother of three was on a flight by myself with some time to read , so I bought `` Twilight \'\' .

The `` Twilight \'\' books are my absolute FAVORITE guilty pleasure -- I love the fluff , the cheesy dialogue , the LOVE -- all of it . For me , `` New Moon \'\' really needed to redeem all that was wrong with the `` Twilight \'\' movie . After watching `` Twilight \'\' last year , I was SO disappointed . Catherine Hardwicke had just taken our beloved series and turned it into a made-for-TV movie . I laughed at all of the wrong places . How Bella and Edward fell in love was completely rushed .

Sure , `` Twilight \'\' was fun to watch because it was `` Twilight \'\' , but the portrayal was so , so , so wrong on so many levels .

439,48_3_R2273NJEQ6LOT3.txt,' As an avid user of smartphones , for years I \'ve completely ignored a series of dull , uncreative phones running windows . While a variety of hardware form factors , some even technically superior to the competition , have come out , the software continued to look incredibly boring compared to the iPhone , Android , and even Blackberry . The main selling points consisted of `` It runs windows and has a start button like you \'re used to on a computer \'\' and `` We have Office and sync with Outlook ! \'\' . While these may have appealed to some business customers , the consistently shrinking market share of Windows phones demonstrated their lack of appeal to consumers as the recent smartphone boom hit . With the HD2 this trend may finally be coming to an end . In conjunction with HTCs beautiful Sense interface , some aggressive hardware , and some genuine innovations , the HD2 is a Windows phone I can actually use and recommend . Let \'s start with the pros and follow up with a few drawbacks . * * Hardware * * -The 1ghz Snapdragon processor coupled with 448mb of ram is blazing fast . This is the fastest speed in a phone currently available . The HD2 loads everything quickly , and can run multiple apps at the same time . You can feel how fast the phone runs by playing with it for a few minutes . Gone are the sluggish Windows Phones of old , constantly running out of memory and crashing . The HD2 is fast and has top notch hardware and you can feel it . -The screen is huge : 4.3 inches and stretching from corner to corner . The Resolution at 800x480 pixels means you \'ll see much more on that big screen than average . That means more room for icons and that sexy weather display on the main screen . -The HD2 supports 3g on T-mobile , including the upcoming higher speed 3g . This means the fastest downloads and best call quality available . Note : the phone does NOT have ATTs 3g bands and the 3g will not work if you \'re using it unlocked on ATT . -5mp camera with auto focus and 2 LEDs . 5mp is the highest we see on most phones , and the camera looks great . Having not 1 but 2 LEDs for flash seems a bit silly but works well . The phone even comes standard with a little flashlight app for a blindingly bright way to see in the dark . -Included 3.5mm jack - this is becoming standard on most phones , and it \'s great to see it on the HD2 . This allows you to use standard headphones without an adapter when playing music or listening to the built in FM Radio . -Included wifi , bluetooth , and a hardware ( real ) GPS for turn by turn directions round out all the bells and whistles included in the phone . -Battery life is similar to most smartphones . You will easily get a day \'s use without having to charge , but most likely you \'ll have to plug it in at night . * * Interface * * -HTC Sense is what really makes the phone shine here . This part of the software is done by HTC , not Windows , and runs on top of standard Windows Mobile 6.5 professional . HTC Sense expands on the previous TouchFLO 3d interface and enhances the way customers interact with the phone . Sense creates the beautiful Today screen , animations for messages , social networking features . It also lets you interact with the phone in unique ways , such as pinching to zoom . Some of these features are so close to the iPhone that Apple has recently filed lawsuits against HTC . -The home screen is customizable , though not quite to the extent of Android phones . It lets you place a few apps on the screen , along with a beautiful standard weather app that detects your phone \'s location and shows the current time and weather in your city . -Touch is a much better experience on this phone than previous windows mobile phones . The screen is capacitive , meaning it uses touch instead of pressure . No awkward stylus or pushing is needed for the touch to work . The phone responds quickly and smoothly to any motions . -Basic phone features like placing a call or sending a text remain simple , with big buttons on the main screen to do so . -Typing on the touchscreen is a breeze due to the size of the screen allowing for a bigger keyboard . As someone who has often stuck to phones with hardware keyboards due to inaccurate screen keyboards , I found typing on the HD2 much easier than previous touchscreen keyboards , although still not as easy as using a hardware keyboard . The HD2 also includes the new SWYPE interface , which lets you type by dragging your fingers through all the letters of a word instead of tapping each one . SWYPE was surprisingly accurate in typing the correct word and will even learn new words once you type them manually . * * Included Apps and Accessories * * -This phone is being marketed as a media phone , and includes several media apps to demonstrate that . MobiTV lets you watch what is essentially Cable TV on your phone free for 30 days and then ten dollars a month after that . Blockbuster lets you rent or buy movies for your phone . Barnes and Noble eReader lets you purchase ebooks . -The phone comes with a huge 16gb MicroSD card out of the box . This is the biggest memory card available currently , and gives you plenty of room for pictures , videos , music , and apps . The best memory card pairs perfectly with the best processor and screen , and it \'s great that HTC did not hold back on this extra . -Full videos of Transformers 1 and 2 are preloaded on the memory card . These videos look great and show off the beautiful screen . Note the movies do take about 4gb of space on the memory card . -The phone comes with a gel skin in the box to protect the phone , which you would have to buy separately on most phones . * * Drawbacks * * -Price is the number one concern here . The phone is priced higher than competing smartphones . This price seems justified , however , due to the cutting edge hardware in the HD2 . It also comes with some nice accessories you \'d have to buy separately from other phones . Upgrade and new customer deals will certainly lower the cost for those buying from T-mobile . -The app store is another drawback . The good news is that the phone has one , the bad news is it \'s the smallest of ANY smartphone operating system . As of this review the Windows Marketplace carried less than 1,000 applications , compared to Android at 20,000 apps and iPhone at a staggering 150,000 apps . Even Blackberry , Palm , and Nokia carry more apps than Windows . You are also going to find significantly more paid than free applications for Windows Mobile apps . The Marketplace is simply far behind that of competing phones , which for a heavy app user will diminish the enjoyment of the HD2 by quite a bit . -Windows Mobile 7 upgradeability is still up in the air , but it currently looks like this phone will NOT be getting an upgrade when the new OS is released . The phone does not support some key hardware feature ( front buttons ) that WM7 requires , and therefore it is unlikely to be upgraded . The upcoming OS promises to be very exciting , and the fact that this beautiful phone will probably not receive the upgrade is disappointing . Overall this phone is fast , pretty , and offers top of the line features . The phone feels solid ( and huge ) in your hand , while the software is fast , works well and is fun to use . If the HD2 is any indicator , Windows Mobile may become a legitimate competitor in the smartphone market again . The phone seems to be selling very well , with T-mobile selling out almost everywhere the day the HD2 was released . I \'d recommend this phone as a viable alternative to Android and the iPhone .

444,17_18_R1HR9M0SMXE9WA.txt,' This was an interesting read . Why spend all sorts of money on yarn when I already have two fuzz producing critters ? But then again who wants to wear a hat that smells like dog ? Smell was my biggest worry when I ran across this book . I know only too well how stinky my wet dogs can be , but apparently they say the smell can be washed out quite permanently and easily and then they ask if one has ever smelled a sheep up close . Good point ! With smell issues out of the way , I read on with interest . Instead of throwing away all of that lovely golden fur floating around my home , I might actually be able to use it . Of course this involves quite a bit of work . Daily brushings , the labor intensive washing , washing and washing again of the fuzz ( without clogging your drain in the process ) , then one must card ( comb ) the fuzz so it all lays the way it should , then you \'ve got to oil it , spin it ( an art in itself ) and ply it into yarn . Yikes , it looks so easy when laid out in a few pages in a book but it sounds too much like work for someone like me . After you \'ve done all of the above , if you \'re one of those inexhaustible types , you can knit hats , scarves and just about anything that you \'d knit with wool . The projects seem pretty straightforward but the instructions assume one has some familiarity with knitting . There are scarves , hats , mittens sweaters , even a doggie sweater ( the pic shows a pug smugly wearing a sweater made from newfoundland fur , way too cute ! ) . You must know the basic stitches , know all about knitting the round , know how to use your double pointed and circular needles and how to work fair isle/intarsia if you want to finish many of these items . I would \'ve appreciated a little knitting 101 section here ( especially for the color work , are you supposed to purl or knit the colors ? ? ) , but that \'s just me and I suppose that stuff can easily be found on google but still . . . The other downside of this book are the black and white photos . The items are described as beautiful tones of `` golden retriever fur \'\' or whatever and then they show a grainy b & w photo of a fuzzy looking scarf which was so disappointing . There also are not nearly enough photos showing how to make and use the drop spindle ( though the carding section was well illustrated and appears simple enough ) . I seriously doubt I could learn the art of spinning dog fuzz using only this book and will look for a video if I ever get my fuzzies washed and ready ( I think this part intimidates me the most ! ) . There is a section outlining breeds and their `` spinability \'\' for those on the lookout for fuzz machines . Lucky for me , my two goldens are top producers but my lab is a poor choice . Apparently , though , his `` short chocolate sprinkles \'\' can be added to all of the glamorously soft golden fur to spice up the color . Who knew ? This was an informative , very niche book , that takes its topic seriously and was a fun read . It \'s got me looking at the fuzz balls in a new way but I \'m not sure if I \'ll ever work up the energy to collect , wash , card , and then spin this stuff into workable yarn because I \'m just too lazy . Though it might make a nice little side business for someone with a lot of time to spare . Imagine a keepsake of your beloved pet like no other . The possibilities are endless . . . ',normal

448,31_18_R1B301RNW4MUJL.txt,' I hear this novel has sold over 6,000,000 copies . Mr. Brown is no doubt pleased , and loses little sleep over the possibility that in six years no one will be reading his blockbuster . He has his villa on the Riviera , if he wants it . I do not wish to disparage his talents . Suppose you wish to write such a novel and have in mind several characters . Character A ( a handsome American , by the way ) is perhaps the world \'s leading authority on , say , symbolism . Character B ( beautiful by the way ) is a brilliant young French cryptologist . Character C ( incredibly wealthy and charming ) is an eccentric old English peer who happens to have spent his entire life studying early Christian exotica , including secret societies and the legend of the Holy Grail . Fate throws them together one dark and stormy night in Europe . The action is precipitated by character D , a hulking religious albino homicidal maniac who wears a monk \'s robe and favors barbed wire garters . He is a ( fictitious ) postulant in service to Opus Dei ( God \'s work ) , an arch-conservative semi-secret Catholic sect that is obviously up to no good -- desiring , as they do , to crank the wayward church of today back a thousand years or so to when Christians really knew how to suffer . D is not the villain , by the way , and his passion for slaying is excused by the fact that when a kid , other kids teased him about his size and lack of pigmentation . Okay , now you have four highly original characters , and an opening sequence in which , it turns out , several perfectly nice and distinguished old fellows are murdered by the monk . Where do you go now ? Well , in this enlightened age , you know how readers love books that moon religion , and especially if the moon-ee is the once venerable but now scandalized Catholic Church . But you ca n\'t just make stuff up , at least not all of it , so you have to do some hard work called research , or hire someone to do it . What you dig up does not have to be entirely true , as long as it is interesting , especially if it is a little titillating to one \'s baser instincts . History being what it is , and humans being who we are , you will discover a number of unsavory truths mixed in with a larger number of equally unsavory untruths , rumors , suspicions , legends , and valid questions . As a creative person endowed with artistic license , you may crayola some of these tidbits to make them even more delicious , if not salacious . This is called `` mining the vein of history . \'\' If you are diligent and blessed with a certain intelligence , you will , out of this stew of possibles , come up with a substory that is so gripping , so bizarre , so full of lust and corruption that few will not want to hear of it . More work is ahead , for your true genius is revealed in how you plot the story . When is `` fact \'\' X , hinted at or revealed , and by whom or what ? Character A knows much , but not enough ; enter character B , to complement A \'s knowledge . Even the two are still insufficient ( although they are falling in love ) . Alas , even the vast erudition of C leaves us wanting . Read on ! Read on ! Maybe , dear reader , after I do n\'t know how many hundreds of pages , you get tired of the author \'s continuously advancing carrot and you flip to the final pages to find the final answer . Then you might wish to turn to another novel about real people in a real world , such as A month in the Country , by J. L. Carr ',ironisch
1021,8_8_R1UADG0E4JLKCE.txt,' Please do n\'t even bother watching the first 3 season \'s of this series because watching the 6th season is like watching a totally deferent show . Nothing is cohesive and if your an actual fan of the core 5 characters do n\'t even bother because theirs hardly any interaction between them . I remember watching the pilot of this show and thinking it had some potential to be great especially with the whole relationship with Dan , Lucas , and Nathan . Six episodes into season 1 I was hooked , everything was so realistic fun and new . I actually found characters that I loved and rooted for and character developement was at all time high . Two seasons later I would never have thought I would stop watching , all the character developement that was built during season 2 & 3 was shot to hell with season 4 .

1213,3_2_R3IGU0BNYTSUQ0.txt,' Firstly I \'d like to say I \'m a 43 year old mom . I got into gaming several years ago and my kids and I have a lot of fun with the Nintendo DS . We have had the original DS , DS Lites , DSi \'s , and now the DSi XL . I got an XL for myself . My son has many GBA games so he does n\'t want one ( because the DSi XL can not play any GBA - Gameboy Advance- games ) and my daughter thought it was too big to be portable . She likes something that fits easily into a backpack or jacket pocket . Although I think the XL could I \'d probably agree if you are going for portability then the regular DSi should do you just fine . The reason I chose the XL is because I play primarily at home and I play a lot of puzzle games . Someimes these types of games are hard to see , especially the seek and find . I \'m hoping this larger sized one helps that . Even though I knew it was larger it is LARGER than I thought . That \'s a good thing because it is almost more like a PDA or something as far as size . Nice and substantial . It is also heavier than I anticipated . This is the only thing I \'m a little concerned with as I like to play laying in bed at night and sometimes I \'ll play for a couple of hours . I would not want my hand getting extra tired holding the unit up . Additionally it is not as easy to hold this one handed and put the stylus in the other . It might be a fine line but it does n\'t quite feel as comfortable as the DSi in that regard . It feels similar to how the PSP would feel if you held it one handed . Slightly off balance . Edited to Add : Played for 2 hours last night . Although it took a while I did find a comfortable position to hold the XL . It is not as comfortable for extended periods as the regular DSi but it did not get too heavy and my arms did not get sore . I \'m quite relieved ! The top part actually has an audible click when you open up the unit . The DSi did not have this click although one of our DS Lite units did . The regular DSi opened smoothly without any catches -- this one does not . There is definitely a click . The hinge looks strong enough . We lost one DS Lite to the hinge crack issue so I \'m glad to see these hinges look sturdy . The other thing regarding the hinges is that the top piece moves a little when you move the unit . It is not super floppy but it does move when the unit does . I tested it against the DSi and the DS Lite and it took more effort to make those cover or top pieces move . It may be the weight itself which causes this . I will be keeping an eye on my hinges though just to be sure . It connected right up to my internet with no problems . I went into the DSi shop and I did n\'t notice any difference between the XL and my regular DSi . Flawless . I must say , though , that I HATE that I could not take my DSi games with me to this upgrade ( Nintendo is so far behind the ball on this and it is one of few complaints I have of Nintendo ) . Lame Nintendo . Seriously lame ! I got the bronze . It has a nearly black top and the inside is black . The bronze is only on the bottom and sides and it is definitely bronze . From the pictures online it looks more chocolate brown but it is not . I wavered back and forth with this and burgundy . I have not seen the burgundy out of the box but suspect it looks gorgeous . The glossy top looks like an overcoat similar to what is put on cars and trucks . Not like how the DS Lite covers were ( although in two tone color this one is nearly exactly the same as the DS Lite Crimson or Blue with the colors in the same places and black in the same places except for the top because this one has the bronze color around the edges and the DS Lite \'s had the crimson or blue ) . It does not feel `` matte \'\' on the bottom.It has a slightly grainy feel -- not sure how to describe it . Kind of like how the non shiny cover of my printer feels . I remember when I got the DSi it almost seemed grainy and powdery . Not so with the XL . Overall I \'m very happy with the color-its classy ! Screen : This was my big worry . So far those worries are fairly groundless . I \'ve tested out several types of games and in most apsects it is absolutely as good as the regular DSi . For the most part I get no pixelation or stretching and I definitely have n\'t noticed any ghosting or lines . While I was playing Bejeweled Twist I did notice that the gems were not as crisp as they are on the regular DSi . For me it was noticable but not bothersome . They were not blurry just a little more fuzzy than normal . Edited to Add : I \'ve tried several additional games and have n\'t noticed any issues except on games like Lunar Knights which already had a more pixelated look even on my DS Lite and regular DSi . Just slightly more noticable here but again not enough to impact . If I was n\'t such a video game addict I likely would n\'t notice but I play every day . My original DSi had several problems ( Nintendo sent me a replacement ) -this one has none of them . The battery cover does not `` cave \'\' in like my DSi and the insert window around the touch screen is solid -- no light shows through . This XL feels as if it is a much higher quality console . I \'ve played with the regular stylus and the bigger pen type stylus . Either is fine but I prefer the regular stylus . The pen stylus might be good for someone who likes to hold the stylus like a pen but it is not a make or break for me . The other functions ( camera and the settings ) worked well . No problems encountered . The charger looks to be the same as the regular DSi and this unit fits fine in my G Pak organizer . Edited to Add : Sound -- it is actually slightly better sounding than the regular DSi . It feels as if it almost has a deeper sound . More like surround type sound . Also if you have a regular DSi there is a point when you are adjusting sound where it goes from quieter to regular and almost seems like it skips a step . The XL does not do this -- the sound progression is very good . I put in my Dragon Quest V as the music is very majestic and it felt more like it was enveloping me in the sound than a regular DSi ( tested it with my daughters ) . Overall I \'m very happy and will update with the weight issue if it becomes a problem . Other than that I \'m excited to go play my games and see them on the big screen ! ',normal

1201,40_14_R1HO44FD6VYEXY.txt,' My wife got me this for my birthday last month , and I was really excited about trying it out ... which , like a kid with a new toy , I did almost immediately . The instructions are easy to follow and the components are easy to assemble and use -- I had my first batch ( of \'Cowboy Lager \' ) sitting in the keg after about 45 minutes of reading and work in the kitchen . The minimum amount of time the mix needs to sit in the keg is 7 days -- I let this first batch sit for 11 . The longer the time in the keg , the more flavor it \'s supposed to develop . I bottled the mix -- 8 liters in all -- and that was another simple process , going exactly as described in the instructions . The beer has to ferment in the bottles for no fewer than 7 days in order to carbonate . My 8 bottles are still sitting , after 8 days . I plan on letting them sit for another week before putting them in the fridge so they \'ll be \'conditioned \' in time for Christmas . I did , however , make an extra bottle from the first batch , in an extra bottle I had . I drained the keg almost dry to do it , even pouring in some of the sludge that had settled at the bottom . The stuff was orange and cloudy ! I let that sit for the minimum 7 days , and let it condition in the fridge for only 1 ( although the instructions recommend at least a week ) . I wanted to try something close to the minimum standard for the mix and the kit in general ... and I have a mug of the stuff next to me as I type . Final verdict on this \'minimum mix \' -- it \'s quite good ! It was adequately carbonated , and produced a smooth head that had a nice smell and flavor . The beer itself is about the same color as a typical American brew -- Coors or Michelob -- and has a very light flavor , with a slightly dry aftertaste . It \'s something I could enjoy in the middle of summer . And remember : this , according to the instructions , is the swill . The better stuff will come out of those bottles that are going to ferment for another week before I cool them . I \'m fired up ! I made my next mix today -- American Blonde -- which was also included in the set . I \'ll let that sit in the keg even longer to see how the flavor develops . All in all , I \'m really happy with this as a present , and even happier about what \'s it \'s produced . This is n\'t just a gift that seems cool : it \'s already exceeded my expectations . This section added on 8 June 2009 : I \'m now carbonating my 17th two-gallon batch . Yes , that \'s a lot of beer , considering that each batch makes 20-24 bottles , depending on how much water I decide to add ( sometimes a little more if it \'s a heavy brew with a lot of ingredients ) . ANYWAY , I \'m still as fired up about this thing as I was when I got it . We \'ve bought two six-packs and one twelve-pack of beer from the store since December , and that was mostly to harvest bottles for future use . I do not miss buying beer at the store ... mine is better , and cheaper , too . My only recommendation is to get 12-oz brown glass bottles , a hand-held capper , and O2 barrier caps -- then you can bottle your own \'normal \' bottles , and you can reuse them . The 1-liter PET bottles that came with my set are fine , as they keep the carbonation well , but I do n\'t like opening that much beer at once unless I have people over . Standard bottles are far more convenient . Mr. Beer rocks . That is all . ',normal

459,7_6_R5YA6HVCMI8VW.txt,' M.A.S . Abdel Haleem \'s English translation of the Qur\'an is the best that I have seen . Some of the other English translations available , use awkward forms and archaic words that are difficult and tedious for the modern reader . But Haleem \'s translation is easy to read , yet scholarly . His footnotes , chapter intro \'s , and the historical background preface , is highly informative to the western reader ; who may not be familiar with the history of Islam . My problem is not with the translation , it is with the book itself . For a supposedly holy book , the Qur\'an is rife with errors . Take for example Chapter 20 ( Ta Ha ) , where Pharaoh supposedly tells his magicians that for their betrayal to Moses , they \'ll be crucified . The Exodus took place around the 14th century B.C . however , crucifixion was not invented until the 6th century B.C . by the Persians . In chapter 58 ( The Dispute ) Allah permits lying , but he damns those who `` knowingly \'\' lie . Does that make any sense ? The Quran also permits hitting women ch 4:34 , lying ( because Allah is a liar ch 3:54 ) , Jihad ( holy war against non-Muslims ch 3:168-175 ) , and in no uncertain terms damns those who believe that Jesus is God ( Christians ) ch 4:170-173 . The Qur\'an is also very anti-Semitic . The Qur\'an does not even compare to the Bible in : reliability , historicity , complexity , beauty , or applicability . No , the Qur\'an seems like a jumbled collection of chapters that are highly repetitive and lack any real sense of order or flow . The Allah of the Qur\'an takes delight in damning the non-believers , and repeatedly states that those who `` ascribe partners with God \'\' ( Christians and the Trinity for example ) , will be damned . Do n\'t believe me ? I took notes throughout the entire book , noting the errors , contradictions , and hateful theology that are found in the Qur\'an . I challenge others to do the same . So people need to read the Qur\'an before thinking that Islam and Christianity are compatible , because clearly they are not ! The Jesus of the Qur\'an is a prophet ; the Jesus of the Bible is God , big difference people ! ! And it does n\'t stop there ! Haleem \'s translation is good , but the book that he translated is not ! ! ! ',normal

1176,23_6_RE7H9EZD0YZ3X.txt,' Ok , there seems to be some confusion as to what this product will do over the mini-dvi to VGA adapter that Apple sells , so I hope I can shed some light on the matter . The mini-dvi to VGA allows you to display your computer monitor on your television screen with resolutions that your COMPUTER MONITOR is capable of . This is very limiting as most TVs will not support the higher resolutions of the monitor , leaving you with little better than 800x600 . In comes the mini-dvi to HDMI adapter , which allows you to display your computer monitor on your television , but the real magic is in the resolutions you are now given . The resolutions are HDTV compatible , allowing for HD viewing ( I view mine in 720p ) . If you \'re looking for a quick answer , this product is much better than any mini-dvi to VGA that is out , simply for the fact that your resolution will be higher on the TV , resulting in a clearer picture and much more readable text .

This is n\'t a real big deal , but I really like the way the individual grips are packaged . They are more folded than rolled , which prevents the overgrip from rolling up by itself after you \'ve unraveled it . Again , NOT a big deal , but an added bonus IMO . The texture of this grip is just tacky enough where it does n\'t interfere with quick grip changes . It is , however , sticky enough to adequately stay in your hand without you having to worry about a slippery handle .

470,20_2_R1MSIY7L7P0U3T.txt,' To begin this review , let me just say that I am a silly romance movie connoisseur . The cheesier they are , the better . Unfortunately , despite the fact that I went into this movie open minded , I did n\'t really like it that much . I have not read the books so I understand that that might have been my problem . While others had a strong foundation and understanding of the Edward/Bella relationship , the movie made it seem like super puppy love as opposed to the undying forever love that I imagined this story was trying to establish , To be fair , I kept comparing the romance to Buffy and Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer . There was so much development to their love ( granted it was a tv show so they had more time to create their romance ) but I really felt that during this movie , Edward and Bella seemed to fall in love over night ... and that may be how love is in high school , but I expected more and deeper interaction . This was also upsetting in light of all the many airy non-dialogue scenes of them looking at each other or holding each other . I thought that time could have been used better . Edward came off as kinda of weird . Very attractive but WEIRD . The whole storming out of class thing looked more like he had to go to the bathroom than like he was terrified of Bella \'s unreadability . His awkwardness was especially strange in light of the fact that he turned into a super cool guy when they started going out -- taking her to dinner after saving her from those brutes and walking into school and prom with his arm around her . I can see how people like Jacob better . Despite going through high school so many times , Edward does not seem well-adjusted whereas Jacob seems like a nice cool guy . I was more interested in the background characters than anything else . Edward \'s family seems fantastic . The baseball scene was really fun and cute . The fact that they tried to cook for her also seemed so wonderful . Also , Bella \'s dad seems great . I hope the story develops their relationship more . I will probably watch the second movie but if that one still lacks substance rather only devoted to Edward and Bella \'s longing glances at each other , that will be it for me . I tried . ',normal
471,33_13_R2V5DY325ZGHZT.txt,' I purchased a UFO-01 a while back and I must say , it had served me well . I personally think that it wards off aliens , as it has not uttered a peep in the last thirty years . A couple months ago , the 9-volt battery in my UFO-01 detector leaked lithium all over the device . Imagine how disappointed I was ! Anyways , I figured that it was probably time for a new detector . I noticed that Image SI had come out with an updated version of the UFO-01 for the same price , so I decided to upgrade . My main concern in purchasing was the lack of Alien-prevention technology , which is standard in many comparable devices , in the UFO-02 . But as I learned in school , first is the worst and second is the best so I took the plunge . Plus , it is only $ 150 , a relative bargain as anyone who knows anything about alien detecting can tell you . Setup and installation was a breeze . I put it up on my roof for optimal alien-detecting and promptly felt reassured that I could once again tell when aliens were finally coming to our fair planet . However , the very first night , the built in LED started flashing and a loud , persistent beeping awoke my entire neighborhood . I , of course , recognized that aliens were coming and grabbed my katana from under my pillow . No aliens were going to anally probe me . But after extensive searching around my entire town , disguised as a lamppost , I found no traces of aliens anywhere . I can only conclude that the UFO-02 must have sent out a false alarm . I am fairly unhappy about this as my UFO-01 had never even once sounded a false alarm . Also , my neighbors are fairly unhappy with me , even though I was simply acting in their best interests when I razed their houses in search of aliens . I had viewed Image SI as a manufacturer of quality equipment but obviously that perception must be re-evaluated . Additionally , I had to climb back onto my roof to turn off the device , and the battery ran out within three days . Those 9V lithium batteries are n\'t cheap , you know , and Image SI does n\'t even include one with the product . I intend to write an angry letter to the company . ',ironisch

Jackie Kennedy was an invaluable source of wisdon , advice and support to her at this time.She speaks in great detail of the opposition to health care , which was very well financed .

476,18_10_R2FR9TADD3FINM.txt,' I have been enjoying Fallout 3 for about 70 hours now and I am having as much fun now as I was 50 hours ago , which is to say A LOT . I can not speak to the bugs that others seem to be experiencing . In my 70 hours I have had my game freeze only a handful of times , and none of them were anything that was game breaking . I have several friends who are also playing and none of them have expressed any serious glitches either . I have played both the previous Fallout games and vastly enjoyed them both , so to make a blanket statement that `` anyone who was a fan of the first 2 Fallouts will hate this game \'\' is just erroneous . I would agree with someone who said this game is more of a Next Gen title in the Fallout Universe rather than a true sequel to the Interplay games . However , that does not in any way detract from the epic amount of fun to be found in Fallout 3 . The adventuring around the Wastes is the highlight of the game to be sure . The amazing amount of freedom to roam the Wastes is just phenomenal , so much so that once you do decide to progress the Main Story it can seem very limiting and cramped at times , especially when crawling around through the DC Ruins and all the subway tunnels required to get to the Main Mall . However , compared to the vast scope and size of the experience , this is a minor complaint and really a very short and small portion of the game . It should only take maybe 5 hours to explore it all and finish up some questing , then you can Fast Travel back whenever you want and get back to tearing it up in the Wastes . Combat is quality , but it is NOT a Shooter . People expecting Shooter mechanics will be disappointed , as even point blank shooting still utilizes an in game Dice Roll to determine whether you hit and how much damage you do etc . It is likely that people complaining about Ammo or clunky targeting are unaware of this game mechanic , but it is what makes the game an RPG , not a Shooter . There is ample amounts of Ammo ( I have never run out in 70 hours of gameplay and I have killed over 1000 living -isms according to my in game stat sheet ) , but it is not unlimited like a Shooter . The VATS mode is a good way to illustrate the difference . You queue up VATS and it will give you a stop-time targeting system . Within this system , you will be given percentages to hit on various Body parts : 87 \% to hit the head , 95 \% to hit the Body etc . However , these percentages are also indicative of how much of a chance you would have to hit those body parts OUT of VATS as well . So if you have a 50 \% chance to hit a leg in VATS , you have that SAME chance to hit in real-time it just does not illustrate it anywhere . SO even if your targeting arrow is Red , you still only have the same percentage to hit as you would in VATS . Which is to say you will miss and waste a ton of ammo if you just think `` my target is red I can unload a clip \'\' . Dice Rolls are a staple of RPGS , Oblivion had them , it was just not as noticeable because you were using Melee weapons , but every time your guy reared back to swing it rolled the dice to see if you would hit , how much of a damaging blow it would be etc . The game has a wide array of voice acting , some is great , some not so much . The story has its ups and downs , but is good enough to not take away from the overall ( it certainly helps that the great Liam Neeson is the Vault Dweller \'s Father , he is an example of the Great voice acting ) . Various mini-quests are actually more entertaining and interesting than the main story , so there is definitely enough Good story in the game to keep it interesting . However , the game \'s strength is in solo-adventuring IMO . While you can get sidekicks and helpers , the real fun is being a Hero of the Wastes and taking down Super-Mutants , Raiders , Slavers and Death Claws all by your lonesome as you scour the Wastes in search of unique weapons , caps , ammo and mini-quests littered throughout . Overall , I would rate the game a 9/10 and consider it the only game on Xbox 360 that gives Mass Effect a challenge for best title . ',normal

Most cartridges are around $ 90 ; compare that to quickutz & sizzix alphabets which retail for $ 150 , can only cut one size , and take up a lot more storage space . Blades are easy to replace and the cutting mats seem to last longer than cricut suggests . You \'ll get more life out of them by rotating the mat each time you cut and also storing it with the plastic sheet to keep dust from accumulating on the sticky surface . I \'ve heard of people having difficulty cutting thicker cardstock with this machine , but we have been able to cut bazzil easily by setting the blade depth to 6 and the speed & pressure to their max settings . I \'ve used both the Cricut and Xyron Personal Cutting System extensively and would recommend the Cricut . ',normal

1219,6_13_R18VPDXVRWAEBZ.txt,' Having recently moved into an upscale manufactured housing facility thanks to the luck conveyed upon me by my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt , I stumbled upon the Zubaz pants here at Amazon and decided that these would complement the crisp , confident , and rugged image conveyed by the T-shirt . Black Zebra naturally , as these are the sartorial equivalent of the red power tie or a navy blazer with bright buttons . My buddy has an original pair that I always admired . I should warn that in direct sunlight the high contrast pattern of these pants , if viewed directly , can cause dizziness and disorientation . That \'s why I keep my Oakley Blades on a leash around my neck , just in case . I had just returned to my humble abode from the pheresis donation center when the UPS driver pulled up with my package . Realizing what was being delivered I grabbed the box , thanked the driver and mostly ran up the five steps to my double wide . Hopping on one foot while trying to get my acid washed jeans over my boots , I simultaneously opened the box with what pass for my teeth . As I pulled the silky polyester over my legs I was simultaneously struck by a sense of awe and wonder . That \'s when I fell over and nearly knocked myself out on the rear projection television in the living room . In hindsight I should have realized that this was the first sign of trouble . After putting the pants on and admiring them for a few hours , I went down to the Wal-Mart to get some scratch and wins . I went over to Arbys and smoked half a pack of Marlboro Light Menthols down to the filter while I went carefully through the lottery tickets , rubbing each one on the Moon for luck . After 25 tickets , I had n\'t even won $ 2 ! ! ! ! ! Perhaps it was the nicotine , perhaps it was the sheer awesomeness of my attire which overwhelmed me , but I did n\'t realize that this was another sign that things were not altogether correct . In the next 48 hours I misplaced my keys , lost my job at Waffle House , was rejected by four women I tried to pick up , chipped my remaining front tooth when I botched a flying roundhouse kick breaking up a fight at the roadhouse , and even spilled ketchup on my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt while eating a chili-dog . To add insult to injury , someone keyed my Camaro . Three days later I found myself face down in a puddle of my own sick , choking back the tears of a wasted youth . I do n\'t know how to explain it but the awesome factor of the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt is not in fact multiplied by the Zubaz pants . It \'s like Cold Fusion - once you bring two multifarious confidence and testosterone factors into play , the inverse coalition of chronological extremes dipolarizes the original fulcrum . That is to say , not only do they cancel each other out , you \'re screwed . I \'ve burned the pants , bought another Three Wolf Moon T-shirt and even tried the Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt . Nothing has restored my Mojo . Upon quiet reflection I \'ve come to accept my fate . Do n\'t let this happen to you !

503,4_13_RETS8UQ5PLPFK.txt,' I knew my day was going to improve when the truck pulled up at my home with this cable deep within . No ordinary truck , this one was Holy White , and the gold Delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe . The driver , clad in a robe colored the softest of white , floated towards me on the cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers . He smiled benevolently , like a father looking down upon his only child , and handed me a package wrapped in gold beaten thin to the point where you could see through it . I did n\'t have to sign , because the driver could see within my heart , and knew that I was pure . Upon opening the package , an angelic choir started to sing , and reached a crescendo as I laid this cable on my stereo system . Instantly , my antiquated equipment transformed into components made from the clearest diamond-semiconductor . The cable knew where to go , and hooked itself into the correct ports without help from me - all the while , the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god .

504,7_2_RTJ5MKU1F5XX9.txt,' `` May in Ayemenem is a hot , brooding month , \'\' and so is Arundhati Roy \'s novel The God of Small Things . Imagine a cold piece of butter slowly melting in a frying pan , setting the scene for the cooking to come , and you can see the way Roy \'s prose works . Words that are hot and brooding reel you into an intricate web of family politics and social mores , evoking a feeling similar to a written stream of consciencness . Roy writes in layers , except that the layers are both added and taken off ; I was reminded of my childhood when I would eat wafer chocolates from the bottom and the top , leaving the middle until last , because that was the best part . Roy kindly dispells the , often torturous , anxiety of what happens in the end early on in the book . The reader is told what happened before it happened , what happened after it happened , and saves what happened for last . A format that seemingly would put off a reader becomes its most appreciated quality . This book is for everyone ; murder mystery , love story , epic saga all in one . Even if you \'re not the romantic type , the social scrutiny of Indian customs provides for interesting reading . However , if you \'re interested in brain candy , forget it . There is too much to absorb . Emotion and intellect are needed in order to understand the emotion and intellect that are related . You could take in only what is superficially presented , as the plot alone is worthwhile , but you would be missing so much . Rahel , a dizygotic twin returns to the place of her childhood and subesequently a place of unhappiness to see her brother , the other twin , after more than twenty years of separation . Esta , the brother , has stopped talking , and Rahel has stopped feeling . Their reunion allows for the remembrance and grieving of their disasterous youths . They recall small things , seemingly unimportant , yet vital to the reconstruction of their sense of inner peace . They are the same age as their mother when she died , thirty-one . Their house is run down and the only relatives left from the monster in their pasts are , in essence , only waiting to die . Entering their minds through an omniscient voice , we are transported back and forth in time , remembering small things , painting a big picture . We remember a cousin \'s accidental death , and the death of another who served as a scapegoat . We remember how fate can make the strangest families . We also remember Rahel and Esta , and how they `` broke the love laws . That lay down who should be loved . And how . And how much . \'\' While the novel serves to shock the reader from time to time , the pace is slow . Roy \'s style would be described as somewhat verbose for the impatient , yet serves to parallel the way we deal with emotions , hurt , and love in life . Creating a paradox however , this reader went back to re-absorb certain elements of beauty or truth , due to a lack of time created by an impatience to find out what happens next . Although usually overly critical of fiction , I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to read intelligent literature . It gives the reader a chance to realize how profound those small things really are . ',normal
1161,39_16_RV8NRTMB2NT6X.txt,' First of all , where was the Edward and Bella romance that we got in Twilight ? I could n\'t find it . His character was almost nonexistent . The wedding was too rushed , the honeymoon ... not a single intimate conversation . Not really one . About what it was like to be married , how they finally felt about everything that had gotten them to this point , what they hoped for the future , nothing . I felt cheated . Then the pregnancy ... just yuck , how Bella lit up every time Jake came over , meanwhile , Edward \'s going out of his mind and she seems to just not address that . Did it not occur to her how it would make Edward feel when she did stuff like that with Jake ? Her constant disregard for his feelings never ceased to amaze me . And we \'re supposed to like her for this ? I have to admit , I loved the delivery scene , with Edward having to deliver the baby and her just spewing blood from everywhere . Too bad Jake was there , but it was impossible to shake him , thanks Steph . If they ever make a movie of this one , I want to see that scene . I must say , I have read better transformation scenes in fanfiction . That was weak , but , I like Bella as a vamp much better than as a human . It really helped that she finally cut Jake loose and realized she belonged to Edward . Finally ! It took her becoming a vamp for that to happen ? How stupid was she as a human ? Then the imprinting . Just weird and creepy . Almost incestuous ; just a few days earlier , Jacob is having fantasies about having sex with Bella . Then suddenly , he wants her daughter . Creeped me out big time . Why could n\'t he imprint on Angela or even Tanya ? Oh , I know why , because it would n\'t have fit into the whole bizarro ending she had planned , with the wolves intimidating the Volturi . I did like Seth though ; if anyone had to imprint on the kid , I wished it was him . I also thought Sam would die so Jake would have to become Alpha . But , no , nobody has to die in Stephenie \'s little dream world except for evil Irina , who was simply mistaken and jumped to the wrong conclusion . Off with her head . Oh yeah , I loved how Jake took it upon himself to go tell Charlie , just to keep them from going out of town for a few months . How selfish can you be ? How inconsiderate ? Just another example of how he disrespects Bella \'s decisions . Still supposed to be her best friend and still unable to be supportive . If he could n\'t stand the separation , why did n\'t he just go with them ? They were n\'t going to the moon . I hate Renesmee but I like it better than Nessie . Could n\'t they have called her Rennie .. or what about sticking Elizabeth in there somewhere for Edward \'s mother ? But nothing tops Edward Jacob . I almost barfed . I \'m sure Edward wanted to name his son that . What was Stephenie on when she wrote this ? ? ? I was never worried that E and B would n\'t end up together . She \'s not THAT stupid . But I did n\'t see the baby or the imprinting coming . I thought we resolved the love triangle in Eclipse , but at the reception , there it was again . I wanted to scream and I wanted to slap Bella , and therefore , Stephenie . Jake is hugging her , so Edward comes back and Jake \'s stink is all over her Wedding Dress . Funny , it occurred to me but it did n\'t occur to Bella . She \'s always so worried about hurting Jake but she does n\'t seem to worry about hurting Edward . The only time she did seem to consider his feelings was when she was trying to hide her own pain , with the pregnancy and the transformation . The only time . She could hang onto Jake all she wanted with never a backward glance in Edward \'s direction . Did Stephenie do that on purpose or did she just think that was acceptable behavior ? Is she completely insensitive ? Talk about a big build up with no climax ... let \'s just chit chat with Aro and then glare at each other and then they \'ll turn around and go back to Italy . Yeah , that \'s a great ending ; what a let down . And a love shield ? Yeah , I like Lily Potter too , but I would try to come up with something original for my fourth novel , not something that \'s already been done by JK Rowling . And since when was Bella \'s love her strongest human trait ? Her closed mind , yes , love shield , no . ',ironisch
506,16_7_RS5YPVMYIM7JH.txt,' I have been using this TV for over a month now and everything is good about it so far .

512,28_5_R29UD1SZJMHWBT.txt,' I was really hesitant to buy this phone due to the conflicting reviews I read from various sources . I wanted to replace my Samsung Eternity , which I really loved , but as time went on I found that not having voice dial was a real annoyance , making my blue tooth headset virtually useless . Then again , I did n\'t like the idea of giving up a speedier interface . I made my decision . After getting the Mythic , I \'m happy to announce that all my reservations were put to rest . This phone is everything the Eternity was , except that everything I felt that needed improvement was realized in the Mythic . No regrets here ! My major complaint is that Samsung \'s New PC Studio no longer provides support for backing up your address book , or your calendar events . I \'m sure this has more than a little to do with at & t \'s desire to charge you $ 3.00 per month to do this for you ( address book only ) . You may want to think twice about filling up the 2000 entry capable contact list on the Mythic . If fact , the biggest problem with this phone is that just about every application it offers will suck you dry with a monthly fee , as opposed to a one-time purchase for it . Even Mobile Email with cost you $ 5.00 per month now . I guess we \'re just not paying enough for cell phone service these days . If you want your Outlook Express email on your phone , get a Gmail account with Google , set up their IMAP server , and you can link up with your email and make it look like you \'re sending and receiving from your Outlook account . Once you \'re all set up , simply import your contacts from Outlook Express to Gmail , then bookmark Google \'s link to their Gmail into your phone \'s browser , or download their Gmail app to your phone for free . All your contacts from Outlook will be available either way . UPDATE : After reading a post by E. McGlynn , I can confirm that `` New PC Studio version 1.2.1 IH1 \'\' will allow you to back up your contacts and calendar events . Why this version is n\'t packaged with the Mythic is beyond me , except for maybe the reasons stated above . Thank you , E. McGlynn , so much for your valuable post . Here are some of my impressions of the Mythic : The Interface - Yes , the interface is n\'t as snappy as it is on the Eternity , but you will forget about this when you see the gorgeous 3.3 \'\' , 360x640 pixel screen . I \'m guessing this has something to do with the sluggishness , due to the increased amount of picture data that has to be switched around to form a new screen , or change from landscape to portrait mode . If this is so , it \'s a worthwhile trade-off . The print on web pages is so sharp ; I do n\'t need to zoom in to read the smallest . If you \'re switching from a phone like the Eternity to the Mythic , you just need to learn to relax and slow down a bit when touching your way around the screen . The Touch Screen - There is definitely a learning curve with the touch screen . At first I thought there were times it was unresponsive , and sometimes it still does seem to be , but after a little experience with the phone , these `` unresponsive times \'\' are few and far between . The screen is not only sensitive to touch , but also to how long you touch it for . This is necessary so you \'re not always moving widgets all over the place every time you swipe the screen . When using the browsers ( there are two ) , a prolonged touch will give you more options on the screen . If you \'re somewhere in between with your touch , I feel that this can sometimes confuse the software as to what your intent is , so it does nothing . So you need to practice . Whether you \'re on the home screens , or the menu screens , there are 3 horizontal dashes , side by side , at the top of the screen . When on home screen 1 ( or menu screen 1 ) , the first dash highlights . Screen 2 , the second dash highlights , etc .. When swiping your finger across the screen to change it , it \'s very easy to activate the widgets , causing great frustration . Swipe too hard , you activate the widgets , too soft , the screen does n\'t move . Solution : swipe your finger or thumb across those dashes at the top of the screen . This works so well , it leads me to believe that this was Samsung \'s intent . It only takes the slightest pressure to move the screens , first time , every time ! The Virtual Keyboard - I love this keyboard . As much as I liked the Eternity \'s , this one is better . The keys are offset like a computer keyboard , as opposed to block style , and there are spaces between the keys . The keyboard is plenty roomy enough , and I make much fewer mistakes on it than my previous phone . I can move right along on it with no lag . When changing the keyboard from portrait mode to landscape mode , there is more lag time than I \'m used to on the Eternity , but guess what .... I compared it to my nephew \'s iPhone , and the lag time is the same . Texting is a breeze with this phone . If you \'re in a hurry and need to type super fast , keep the T9 on . It will work like an auto-correct feature . The Camera and Video - Sorry to say , the Eternity , at 3 mpix , no auto-focus and no flash , takes better pictures under more conditions than the 3.2 mpix Mythic WITH auto-focus and a flash . In fact , I \'m finding that the auto-focus is just a time consuming farce . I \'ve been taking identical pictures using the auto-focus , and then just taking the picture without waiting , and there is no difference . If I crop a picture , I find that sometimes the result is clearer WITHOUT the auto-focus . Nice try , Samsung . There were times when my Eternity , under best conditions , took pictures that rivaled those taken with my camera . The pictures on the Mythic can at times be very good , but mostly they are a little fuzzy . Subjects at the edges of the pictures will suffer a little with barrel distortion , but I \'ve found this true with any camera-phone I \'ve owned . Any movement by your subject will show up as a blur in the photo . Under very dark lighting conditions , the Mythic wins over the Eternity , due to its flash , but the pictures will be grainy and the colors will be distorted and washed out . Having said all this , many people will find the pictures to be very good , and in all fairness , they are better than on some popular smart phones I \'ve seen that have 5 mpix . The video recorder on the phone is just adequate . Along with two resolution choices , there are three viewing modes : Small ( picture box ) , Medium ( fills screen top to bottom ) , and Distorted ( fills screen left to right ) . This last mode is horribly pixilated with choppy motion . You choose the mode with the little box in the upper left with the circle in the middle and the arrows radiating out towards the four corners . Oddly enough , the playback of the videos defaults to the worst viewing mode . UPDATE : The default viewing mode for video playback can be changed during the playback of a video . Simply touch the edit icon ( the lined page on top of the horizontal pencil ) at the bottom-left of the screen , and you \'ll see the `` Display Mode \'\' button . Touch this and choose your new default viewing mode . The Internet - There are two browsers on this phone . There \'s the Mobile Web , which at & t seems to promote with its dedicated widget , and then there \'s simply `` Browser \'\' over in applications . Mobile Web is powered by Opera Mini . You must choose your viewing mode , landscape or portrait , mobile or HTML . You do this in `` settings \'\' . This browser does a very nice job rendering web pages . It \'s also the more finicky one when it comes to touch . At first I was touching links three or four times to activate them . You really need to get the hang of it . Once you do , you \'ll find it \'s very responsive with the quickest and lightest of touches . The other browser is the old , familiar one I had on the Eternity . It automatically changes from landscape to portrait , but chooses how the page will load best . This is the browser that the Facebook widget uses . Sometimes the Facebook page loads extra tiny for some unexplained reason . When this happens , the screen can respond strangely when you try to navigate . It will seem to freeze , but then `` catch up \'\' and start moving on it own . Luckily , this happens only sporadically . This browser also allows you open multiple web pages at one time , for tabbed browsing . Also , any links you bookmark with this browser are stored in the `` Favorites \'\' widget on the widget tool bar . Both browsers have their advantages and do a good job . One may render the same page better than the other . The `` Browser \'\' may be better for quickly checking things like weather , sports , etc . The Mobile Web is probably better for surfing content rich websites . It \'s strictly a personal preference . They both have their own personalities , and I use both equally . Voice Commands - This is a great feature for some people . I am a carrier for the U.S.P.S . At certain times during the year , my phone is under 3 or 4 layers of clothes . Two layers cover my head . I do n\'t have time to stop and make phones calls , but if I did , reaching for my phone under those layers with a gloved hand is an invitation to send the phone tumbling to the asphalt . With voice commands , problem solved ! Even with my bluetooth headset under my headwear , people have no trouble hearing me and I have no problem hearing them . At the touch of the button on my bluetooth , I can check time , date , go to voicemail , call the Post Office with a problem , check the phone \'s battery , signal strength , or whether I really did feel my phone vibrate with a new message , and more , all while leaving my phone safely in its holster under all my clothes . This is invaluable for me , though probably not for everyone . The Battery - The battery life is excellent for a phone with such power hungry features . My phone is turned on at 5:30am , and shuts off at 10:30pm . If I use the phone only when needed , there will be at least 4 out of 5 bars at the end of the day , sometimes 5 . If I \'m out and about on a day off , constantly texting , checking Facebook , surfing the web and playing with features that keep the phone backlit constantly , I MAY drain the battery by the end of the day . Most of the time there are one or two bars left . As I \'ve found with most digital volume indicators , the last two thirds of the increments disappear as fast as the first third . They simply are n\'t linear . So if you use 2 out of 5 increments the first day , do n\'t think your phone will last another day and a half of the same usage .

When I first saw this book I thought it would be fantastic to laugh at myself and at recent culture for some of the silly things that we enjoy .

He goes on and on and on ....... about something so that you forget what the main point is . It \'s not funny at all . He tries way too hard . I tried to pick out things that I could relate to or would find interesting and nothing helped . I felt like he was the awkward kid in the corner who thinks he \'s cool , trying to say something that will make everyone laugh but that really you feel sorry for , because he \'s trying so hard , but you ca n\'t help but walk away . The book came up in conversation with a friend of mine , and I offered for him to read it to see what he thought . Needless to say , I was n\'t surprised when he basically threw the book back at me a few days later and said that he could barely get through it and did n\'t come close to finishing it . ',normal

525,20_7_R1S6NN4ICALM8C.txt,' I \'ll admit , I had some reservations about Red Dead Redemption . The studio that released it ( Rockstar ) had n\'t done too much to distinguish it from GTA with horses . Within the first 2 hours , however , I was blown away . The story starts with our hero John Marston attempting to track down his former gang leader Bill Williamson and bring him to justice . After a short cut scene , he \'s shot and left for dead . The game opens up after some dialogue and tutorials , leaving you to your devices in 1912 \'s Texas and Mexico . The first thing you \'ll notice is the beautiful visuals . Everything has an incredible amount of detail and draw distance , and the character models animate wonderfully . Watching the sunset on horseback is a truly visceral video game experience , and wo n\'t soon be forgotten . Combat works in a very fun , gritty way . You have a large variety of period weapons to deal the bad guys ( or good guys ) . Quests can appear by talking to certain NPCs essential to the story . They can also appear at random , forcing you to act quickly or watch an innocent die . What really surprised me was how well the minigames were made . Poker could be sold as a separate game in of itself , with AI `` tells \'\' and bluffing . Five-finger-fillet is pretty funny to watch if you make a blunder . Horseshoes and bar fights provide some enjoyable distractions . You can waltz over to a local movie theater and watch some very funny silent films that convey the mindset of the times . Red Dead Redemption has the most believable open world I \'ve ever played , with every feature one would expect . The atmosphere is simply unmatched in terms of immersion and realism . I have n\'t even mentioned multiplayer yet . RDR supports up to 16 players over Xbox Live or PSN for full-on gunfights and skirmishes . Game types can range from free-for-alls to CTF-structured team based modes . There is also a separate mode called `` Free Roam \'\' that lets you and your friends form a posse and explore the entire single player map . You can slaughter gangs , hunt down wild game , and duke it out with other posses over an enormous map . There \'s a fully featured ranking system that tracks your progress throughout your online exploits . Multiplayer should keep you hooked for weeks on end as you shoot up the West . Overall , Read Dead Redemption is an incredibly good game that ca n\'t be missed . Pretty much everything is perfectly polished and consistent , and you \'ll find yourself loving the Wild West \'s final days . Go buy it now . PROS + Awesome , deep combat + Breathtaking visuals + Addictive multiplayer + Strong voice acting and writing + Best open world in a video game to date Cons - Occasional animation glitches - Some network problems , especially in Free Roam - Could be a little more difficult ',normal

But , this CD ... it \'s self indulgent woo is me and made me realize that Thom Yorke \'s style served as a template for boredom in music . I had just purchased a new stereo and thought a modern CD would be a good way to showcase the music . I was wrong , like that $ 20.00 lottery ticket that loses same concept . This is a band that you never hear anything negative about and any album they release will be praised to the heavens . Good for them , but after buying every Radiohead cd thus far and just selling the majority of them later on ..... 5 star reviews I \'m not falling for them anymore . I think perhaps this music is so ahead of its time I just do n\'t get it . Upon listening the music drones and the lyrics sound like teen angst high school woe is me poetry . Radiohead you are not taking my money anymore . I will always listen to the Talking Heads song `` Radiohead \'\' and think wow this song inspired a band to rip me off and keep coming back for more . Brilliant artwork , brilliant album title but there ai n\'t no Leprachauns or Rainbows here . No pot of gold either . The sublimity of Radio head though is I could say its sad that people flock to each new release by positive reviews and not give other new artists a try but , thats not radioheads fault they sell the cd for any price on their website . The purpose of this review is if you like artists like VNV Nation , Cocorosie , Antony and the Johnsons , Sparks , Pulp , Nico , Leonard Cohen , Nick Cave , Morrissey , T Rex ... then go buy or try a different band . Do n\'t waste any of your money on Radiohead . Go buy a $ 20.00 scratch off ticket instead then you might find yourself in a rainbow rather than this sewer of a CD . Do n\'t Buy it Now .

534,4_5_R3TY5TI3ZHH449.txt,' I \'ve been using the TurboScratcher since it came out in the early 80s as a toy and scratching item for my cats . I have NEVER paid for than about $ 12-13 for it , and the inserts used to be available from WalMart for 3/ $ 9 . The catnip helps get the attention for the scratching part , and once the see how much fun it is to scratch , they rarely go back to carpet or furniture . I \'ve had more than one cat that never ONCE went for furniture because I made sure he/she had her own turbo-scratcher from the moment they arrived in my house . I have one that is a light blue from back in the 80s when everything was light blue and mauve . If left in the sun a bit too long , they do tend to get a little brittle , but while they feel a little flimsy , they are perfect for the cats . For those without carpet -- use the rubber shelf or drawer liner cut in a square or circle a couple of inches bigger than the whole toy and it does n\'t move at all . I have never had any problem on any surface until I recently moved into a house with handscraped hardwood floors that are uneven . This trick worked wonders there and I suspect it would have been more stable on the tile floor in our last house as well , but our cat like to sleep on it in the window in the sun just as much as playing or scratching it . I recommend one to any cat that I adopt out at rescue , and for my foster babies , I give one to the family that adopts them because that \'s what I teach them to scratch on and I do n\'t want them developing bad habits of scratching furniture or carpet in their new home -- where they are often trying to cope with the unfamiliar .

537,43_9_R34HT9IAEJN3E2.txt,' With this his first novel , author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness . Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature . Too often I think , people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding \'s stand on human nature . `` His stance is too pessimistic \'\' or `` That books really gross . \'\' What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it . He was n\'t making things up , I do n\'t think he was particularly angry , he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II . One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course , human nature . William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze : Jack , Piggy , and Ralph . It \'s quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies . Let \'s start with Jack . Jack is the definite Id on the island . He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun . Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island . Piggy is the definite Superego on the island . Piggy is always referring to `` well my auntie ... \'\' and always finds an excuse not to do something . Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id , and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon . Ralph on the other hand , takes the middle road . He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id , but he ca n\'t seem to find one . Take what he said in chapter eight for instance : `` ... Without the fire we ca n\'t be rescued . I \'d like to put on war-paint and be a savage . But we must keep the fire burning ... \'\' Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id , but those laws of culture still remain with him , telling him it \'s not the thing a proper English boy should do . Another interesting connection I made while reading , was one between Jack \'s status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes . Unlike Hobbes though , Jack \'s power was used for quite the opposite affect . Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist , a higher power had to be in charge , in order to keep the other citizens in check . Jack was that higher power on the island . He was in control of everything , however , his power had quite the opposite affect of `` keeping people in check . \'\' Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others . Jack could promise meat and fun , whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit , something the other boys definitely did n\'t want . Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism . Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch . The conchs represented several things , including freedom and order on the island , and possibly , even for a short time , unity between the boys . One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy could n\'t use it . This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy \'s part . The conch became a tool of free speech . Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard . However , as the story progressed , this practice diminished more and more , until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy . In one of the last chapters of the novel , the conch gets completely destroyed . This symbolizes two things . First , it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings , no more assemblies , none of that , the island was a place of anarchy . Secondly , this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph \'s leadership . The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power , their conscience gave in . Finally , about the novel itself . Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad . The writing style is almost identical , and the subject matter is very similar , with Golding opting to use children ( young boys ) instead of the men of Conrad \'s Heart of Darkness . The novel moves very quickly and it \'s rather short ( 202 pages in my copy . ) You \'ll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present . Keep in mind , that although Golding \'s view on humanity may seem very pessimistic , he \'s writing from his perspective on human nature , something that he witnessed first hand during WWII .

They have accomplished both objectives with flying colors . The sound quality is excellent . I can hear absolutely everything , even the faintest sound cues I could never hear before . Just the ability to hear footsteps , the direction that they are coming and what they are walking on makes all the difference in multiplayer . Before ordering them , I read many reviews that mention a hiss when the headset is plugged in and was a bit worried that this might be an issue . There is a hiss , but it is so negligible that it is n\'t even worth listing as a con . Almost all the other reviews that I \'ve read that mention this hiss also mention that you ca n\'t even hear it during gameplay . Does n\'t that pretty much disqualify it as a con ? Honestly , these things could play Home On The Range until I put my MW2 disc in the drive for all I care . There has to be absolute silence in the game in order to hear the hiss . As soon as any music or in game action starts , it is gone , in no way hindering your gaming experience . I also did n\'t have any problem hearing this hiss while using the X11s with my iPhone for music or YouTube . The ability to control both the game and chat volumes works very well . I \'ve played several very long MW2 multiplayer sessions with friends and I have n\'t had any issues with my friends hearing me or vice versa . I love that when you raise the game volume , it automatically adjusts the chat volume so that the game audio does n\'t drown it out .

1092,23_11_R137SGNP3PL2PV.txt,' Do n\'t waste your money on this convoluted and unfriendly piece of overpriced junk . Spend less and get much more . I should also mention Apple \'s crappy return policy for items bought in their store -- 14 days . If you find out too slowly how lousy this item is , you are stuck with it . And do n\'t give it as a gift at Xmas -- your recipients ca n\'t return it either . You have given them an expensive paperweight unless all the stars are in alignment for them , andthen they \'ll probably find it useless anyway . First , users need a very fast computer to make iPod touch work at all . It also needs a $ 50 a month home broadband connection ( or a long , long visit to Starbucks ) to download the absolutely required iTouch software before the object is more than a bad paperweight , and only if users meet all of those prerequisites , will they have the barest hope of seeing the choppy , vastly oversimplified and way , way too fast video instruction set , to get any music or apps . Of course , getting apps or new music from Apple means having a wifi connection , so users are stuck at home or at Starbucks to do that . With all those stars in alignment , users will soon realize how taken they are . Every `` feature \'\' and app is easily duplicated on cheaper , better equipment with screens you can see and read , headsets that do n\'t sound tinny or fall out of your ears , and good apps that you do n\'t have to pay for over and over . Obviously , a $ 300 netbook does everything a thousand times better and does far more than the $ 300 iPod Touch , at the cost of what , 8 ounces to pack around ? What exactly are you doing in the library with your iPod ? Typing your term paper ? I think not . The very fact you ca n\'t print , save or offload anything you write or find on the Internet makes for a huge , unexplored mystery , another Apple black hole in product design , that should keep you from spending your hard earned dollars , euros , whatever . The fact you ca n\'t buy for love or money a decent cover to keep the glass from scratching should clinch that decision . But particular demerits for the iTunes software , which took an hour to download and set up , because it is pathetically slow , and if you ever figure it out -- I figure you devote 15 or 20 hours to it and you may start to get the hang of it because does n\'t work as it seems it should or as its limited instructions indicate -- you \'ll find it lame because cutting and pasting to folders ranges from cumbersome to impossible . iPod also has vicious default settings that you wo n\'t know about or know to change in the set up in the absence of advance instructions -- defaults that can sync your music and pix out of existence before you can stop that from happening when charging up . Yet it somehow ca n\'t upload what you want to add unless you spend an hour ( without the benefit of any instructions ) trying to figure out the one and only permitted place for upload stuff to be to get it into iPod ( cutting and pasting to iPod as with a thumbdrive is simply not permitted , nor is avoiding iTunes , so Apple can presumably keep track of what you are doing ) . While the iPod may be able to hold thousands of photos , do n\'t really try loading them more than 2 or 3 at a time , particularly if they are large size ; the iTunes software simply ca n\'t handle processing them . Forget about giving it to a kid for Xmas . Besides the impossibly stupid return policy , the only porn filters are on buying at the iTunes store . The kid can see what he wants on the Internet with no restrictions whatever . Also , unless you take a lot of cumbersome measures to turn off your credit card info , your kid can spend you into the poorhouse , no way to stop that . That being said , iPod is pretty useless without hundreds of dollars worth of apps and music being loaded into it , so you do the math on giving it to a kid . Forget about a quick juice up . Apple admits it takes 4 hours to fully recharge from zero ( though only an hour to get to 80 \% ) ; do n\'t hold your breath it is that fast , certainly not unless it is plugged into a fast computer with a 2.0 USB or the wall . It took me 1:45 to get it charged to 65 \% , and though unused , was at under 20 \% the next day . Apple also claims its batteries will hold an 80 \% charge after 400 cycles ; this is EPA milage to me . Figure on spending $ 79 plus postage and tax to replace the batteries every year , plus spending a bunch of time trying to offload whatever you do n\'t want to lose , and then waiting to get it back . BTW : mine did not hold a charge for the promised time right out of the box . The stupidity of having buttons do multiple things -- but only if you hold them for the exact right amount of time to the nanosecond so they do n\'t do something else -- is not exactly what I call user friendliness . Forget about typing your messages or searches : typing accuracy is awful because the on-screen keys are tiny , tiny , tiny . If you really need music that much , first try using your home stereo , that \'s why you bought it for many hundreds of dollars . It will sound 10,000 times better and fuller , and you can share it with your friends and family . Even your car stereos will sound better than iPod by far . If you must have music while on subways or while jogging , use a regular Walkman bought in any drug store for $ 30 and regular music disks and regular headphones ; it sounds 50 times better than 128 mp3 \'s that cut off much of the sound not to mention the fall out of your earbuds , for 10 \% of the price . At one time , we were all audiophiles who concentrated on the quality of the sound ; mp3 \'s are garbage compared to regular disks , which are garbage compared to vinyl , especially when the stereo itself has some decent components . Then listening is returns to being about music and not about electronic toys . Even so , a regular disk plays for 70 minutes ; walk around with 3 disks and you are good for 3.5 hours , and quarter apiece batteries last for 10 hours , with no need to walk around with USB adapters and computers or $ 30 apiece AC socket adapters or any extra gadgets needed to charge it up ( if you get 400 cycles before spending $ 79 plus to replace the iPod battery , that \'s still 20 cents a charge ) . But if you must have a lot of music , you can burn those same songs onto your own party disks as mp3 \'s and get about 700 minutes worth on each one , using an mp3 Walkman that costs $ 60 . Do you really need to have more than 12 hours of music in your hands at all times ? Do you really have to watch TV or movies on a screen hardly bigger than your watch ? Certainly not for $ 2 an episode from iTune stores , when current stuff reruns on network websites free , and older stuff is readily available on DVD , using a 10 inch cordless player that costs $ 80 that you can walk around with ( and which will play those mp3 \'s at least as well as iPod for no additional money ) ? Do you really need to have a $ 300 item and a $ 30 dock work and a $ 5 app for your alarm clock when you could get that for $ 20 at CVS ? Do you really need an app tokeep a checkbook that comes with a paper register ? Do you need a paid or Google app to keep track of your own anniversary ? Do you really have to have access to some current books on a 4 inch screen for $ 10 a pop ? What are those paperbacks still doing on your shelf ? Do n\'t waste your money on this overpriced , underfunctioning gadget . Save it for the music itself ( go to a concert or two or three ) . ',ironisch
554,47_11_R2ILJGKKA40H39.txt,' Let \'s start off by saying that I am a big supporter of Apple and their products as well as a proud owner of an iMac , Macbook , iPods , and now the latest and greatest iPhone 4 . And being the Apple fan ( geek ) that I am , I followed the live blog updates from WWDC 2010 a couple of weeks back to get the latest news on the unveiling of the phone . Announcements were being made for awesome new features like Facetime , Retina Display , etc . etc . and ... drumroll please ... a $ 29 piece of plastic combined with rubber that only went around the edge of the phone ? Really ? I mean , I understand that the back is left open for aesthetic purposes ( baby got back ) but I \'m pretty sure that when I drop my phone ( and I will drop my phone ) , my phone is most likely going to land on the back or the front and not on its side . So ... I did a little bit of searching and this product was one the of few that took advantage of the iPhone leak ( thanks to the guy who `` left it at the bar \'\' ) . And it really did take advantage . Very good fit , durable material , cut outs that make sense . And it did n\'t cost me 29 bucks . What more can I say ? It \'s a case that fits and does what it supposed to do which is to protect the phone . And apparently also prevent signal loss to people who hold it in their left hand ( I guess you ca n\'t post links in a review but if you check out engadget , there are a number of articles that will convince you that a case WITH a closed back is very much needed to protect your investment ) . Apple should \'ve included the bumper in the packaging but hey , that \'s how businesses make money . So until they make a bumper where it can shoot laser beams or bring about world peace for a whopping 29 bucks , I think I will be sticking with this case . ',ironisch

If you \'ve had periodontal work or had root canal , implants , crowns or bridges done , you know that figure is not an exaggeration , and you \'re lucky if your insurance covers even a little bit of it . Having seen my relatives go through that , I \'ve decided that as I get older , I want to spend my money on vacations and real estate , and not on painful dental procedures . That \'s why the Sonicare is the most frugal product I \'ve bought . I too have had some costly dental work , and I \'m determined to keep my fixed-up choppers in tip-top condition . This toothbrush is amazing . One thing very few people note about the Sonicare is that it not only cleans your teeth beautifully , it also keeps your gums in great shape , and that may be even more valuable . Here \'s the best testimonial to the Sonicare : I recently had braces for a few years . I mentioned to my orthodontist that I \'d graduated from high school in 1983 , and she said , `` You \'re not that old . \'\' `` Yes , I \'m 40 , \'\' I said .

Surely it ca n\'t be THAT bad , right ? She has credentials , after all . She \'s worked with some respectable collaborators , after all . She can hold a note , after all . Sadly , none of this seems to have counted for much at all . What we have here is the very worst pop sludge , making it \'s ugly way off the predictable , unoriginal treadmill of weak pop music and into the mindset of the hysterical masses , whose purchases and subsequent success of that which they purchase fool both consumer and artist alike into attributing far more quality to a product like this than it actually warrants . Put simply , this is rubbish . Over indulgent , shallow and completely inconsequential rubbish of the kind we \'ll look back at in five years time and wonder what on earth so many people were thinking by buying it in large quantities .

Given her past contacts , this really is unforgivable tripe . Its success is no justification for it \'s supposed quality . We all know that if the sheep are spoon-fed something and told it \'s good by radio stations and celebrity magazines , they \'ll inevitably lap it up thoughtlessly .

562,21_18_R356FQGEE2Q0L6.txt,' In late October , 1991 , the commercial swordfishing boat Andrea Gail left Gloucester , Massachusetts , headed for an area just off Nova Scotia known as the `` Flemish Cap . \'\' The weather in the North Atlantic in the fall is always chancy , but Captain Billy Tyne ( played here by George Clooney ) had been the victim of some poor harvests of late , and he needed fish ; moreover , he knew where to find them . He was also aware of the risks involved at that time of year . What he did n\'t know and could not foresee ( nor could any meteorologist have predicted ) , was that three major storms were about to converge to form one huge storm , the likes of which comes along only once in every hundred years or so . And the course he had set was about to take him , his boat and crew of five men , right into the middle of it . Director Wolfgang Peterson recounts this incident in `` The Perfect Storm , \'\' a deftly crafted and intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail , and its encounter with the storm of the century . What Peterson did with this film , the way he tells the story , can be likened to what Melville did with the novel , `` Moby Dick ; \'\' as it moves along , he fleshes out the characters and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all about . He pays such meticulous attention to details , that by the time you \'re in the middle of the storm , the impact is extraordinary ; you know what this boat is and how it works , you \'ve smelled the fish and the sweat and the sea , and worked alongside the crew . You know these people and what \'s at stake here . You know the feel of the fishing lines and the grappling hooks , felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a big one , or when a huge wave washes over the deck . He gives you so much in this film , puts you in it so completely , that it primes your senses for whatever \'s to come . Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable , outstanding performances , and a terrific score by John Horner , and you \'re in for the thrill of a lifetime . The charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne , and is able to convey a real sense of who this man is without resorting to unwarranted theatrics or bravura . He simply knows him from the inside out , and it shows in the way he carries himself , the way he walks and talks , right down to the look in his eye ; the seasoned professional with all the skill and confidence required of his job , but a man who is nevertheless also aware of his own shortcomings . It \'s a commanding performance with nuance and depth , all there on the screen , and Clooney makes it real . Mark Wahlberg is also outstanding as Bobby Shatford , the rookie fisherman who ca n\'t stand to be more than two feet away from the woman he loves , Christina ( Diane Lane ) . Another notable performance is turned in here by John C. Reilly , who does an emotional turn as `` Murph , \'\' the veteran fisherman who is divorced , has a young son he loves dearly , and lives with the remorse of past mistakes that ultimately destroyed his marriage . Rounding out the exceptional supporting cast are William Fichtner ( Sully ) , Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ( Linda ) , Allen Payne ( Alfred ) , John Hawkes ( Bugsy ) and Michael Ironside ( Bobby Brown ) . There are thrills and heroics to spare in `` The Perfect Storm , \'\' but it \'s also inspiring ; once you \'ve seen the Coast Guard in action , for example , you \'ll never take them for granted again . What makes this such a great movie , though , is that it \'s about real people , an instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary circumstances , and Peterson has made them accessible ; these are people with whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify . This is a powerful , emotionally charged and unforgettable film ; it will take you to places and you \'ll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater ( or on the couch ) that most people will never get close to in real life .

569,18_7_R34LXBIHMBM1YY.txt,' As a proud owner of a PS3 , I was closely following developments of when the rumored ( and highly-anticipated ) PS3 Slim would come out . After shelling [ ... ] for the PS3 80GB back in 2008 , I was really excited to hear that Sony not only announced a smaller version of the PS3 , but also implemented a [ long-overdue ] $ 100 price cut . I immediately went out and bought the Slim as soon as possible , and am very happy with it so far . Here are my impressions : COMPARED TO PLAYSTATION 3 `` FAT \'\' A LOT SMALLER I heard that it was smaller , but seeing is believing ! The photos do n\'t do the system justice , and it \'s not really till you see and feel the difference that you are impressed with it . If you can , go into your local game store and check it out for yourself ! If you \'ve previously owned a Playstation console , you already know the difference the slimmer version makes when compared to the original , bulky ones . What \'s really convenient is that the slimmer PS3 not only means your video gaming is more portable , but that you have a really convenient Blu-Ray player . NOT A FINGERPRINT MAGNET I love the sleek look of my PS3 Fat , but do n\'t like how it constantly needs to be cleaned . The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet ! The matte finish on the Slim is much easier to maintain . That being said , it does n\'t look as shiny and cool , but I think its convenience outweighs that . MORE STORAGE Storage was never an issue for me on my 80GB system , but for those who wanted more storage , you get 40GB more with this system ( 120GB in total ) . It may not seem like much , but you can hold MANY movies , pictures , and music albums with 120GB . If that \'s still not enough , you can always install a 2.5 \'\' hard drive yourself , or better yet , plug in an external hard drive in one of the USB ports . You can easily get a portable 500GB external hard drive for less than $ 100 , or a bigger , bulkier one with around 1TB of storage for roughly the same . That being said , I think 120GB for $ 300 should be more than enough for most users , and is a significant improvement over the 80GB for $ 400 that people were paying just a few weeks ago ! STILL NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE This is my one major gripe with the Playstation 3 . It really would n\'t have killed Sony to include this feature , as the original Playstation 3 \'s did in fact include backwards compatibility with older Playstation 2 games . A lot of people counter by either saying ( 1 ) it does n\'t make sense to buy a PS3 to play PS2 games , ( 2 ) the graphics on the PS3 are better anyway so why bother with older games , and ( 3 ) including backwards compatibility would cannibalize PS3 game sales . While those arguments might have their merits , I \'m still frustrated that my massive PS2 library ca n\'t be played on the PS3 , and was really hoping that Sony would include backwards compatibility on the Slim ! I loved the fact the PS2 was backwards compatible with PS1 games , and really wish that Sony would reconsider this decision . COMPARED TO OTHER SYSTEMS : PS3 vs. WII I think comparing the PS3 directly to the Wii is a bit like comparing apples to oranges , since they offer such different experiences . The Wii in my opinion is more family-friendly , while the PS3 is better for more graphics-intense games geared towards different gemographics . I \'m a huge fan of Nintendo , and I love their very family-oriented game offerings . I own a DS and Wii and still love Mario as much as the days back when I played the original Nintendo ( NES ) . In addition , I think Nintendo \'s motion-sensitive controllers for the Wii are very innovative and fun to play with ! Unfortunately however , for most gamers , the difference in game quality is noticeable when comparing the two systems . The PS3 has AMAZING graphics . On an HD Television , you notice such crisp details while playing the PS3 . The Wii features only Standard Definition output , which noticeably weakens it when compared to the other next-gen consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360 . PS3 vs. XBOX 360 Microsoft has an impressive gaming console in their Xbox 360 and there are some amazing titles exclusive to the Xbox , but in the end you get less bang for your buck when compared to the Playstation 3 : ( 1 ) Online gameplay : You can use the Playstation Network \'s online features without having to pay a subscription fee like you do for the Xbox . I was never a big online gamer but now I enjoy playing against opponents online . ( 2 ) Internet connectivity : Built-in wireless internet connectivity on the PS3 is a much better bet than having to buy a wireless network adapter for the Xbox . Of course you can simply rely on a wired Ethernet connection , but this might be inconvenient depending on your set-up . ( 3 ) High-Def Video : The Playstation 3 doubles as a Blu-Ray player . Microsoft bet on the wrong horse when they were hoping that HD-DVD would come out the winner in the high-def format wars . If you want a Blu-Ray player/video game system combo , the PS3 is a great device . ( 4 ) Failure rate : The Xbox 360 has an absurdly high failure rate , with estimates ranging between 30 to 50 \% ( [ ... ] ) . I ca n\'t verify the numbers , but know from my friends who own the Xbox 360 that they \'ve had a fair share of grief with their systems . Microsoft does have a few edges , namely the upcoming Project Natal , unveiled at June \'s E3 . While Natal may ultimately be one of the most amazing advances in video gaming , it unfortunately is still some time off from being implemented . That being said , the Playstation 3 is much more worth the cost than the Xbox 360 - at least for now . FINAL THOUGHTS [ ... ] system that doubles as a Blu-Ray player . Keep in mind though that the bulk of money spent on the video game system will not be in the initial down payment , but the subsequent games , extra controllers ( only comes bundled with one controller ) , and other peripherals/accessories . [ ... ] . Sony \'s refusal to incorporate backwards-compatibility for PS2 games on the PS3 , however , might make your gaming library obsolete in a few years , so if you have the money , you \'re best off going for the PS3 Slim . You wo n\'t regret it . ',normal
570,27_4_R3G2L5J76XJYMD.txt,' When I first put this album on my wish list , it was something I would have liked to have , but not something that I necessarily needed . When I first listened to it I said , `` Oh this is good . \'\' I didnt listen to the whole album at once . I heard `` Undisclosed Desires \'\' and decided I really liked that song , but nothing else really stood out . Then when I listened further on in the album , I heard `` Exogenesis Part I . \'\' I felt like I had been knocked to the floor and my soul had been ripped out ; a sign of a really good song for me . I do n\'t know how else to describe this piece of music . It \'s not a song , no not at all , it is a piece of music . The orchestration and the singing are so hauntingly beautiful and full of emotion I just want to put on headphones , crank up the volume and let the music wash over me , painting pictures in my head . This is what I like to do when I hear a great piece of music , song or album . After hearing that piece , I decided to read the lyrics . When I read the 1984 themed-lyrics and listened to the album once again , I realized that `` Resistence \'\' is a Rock Opera . All of the songs align together in a common Totalitarian-Theme : when he meets the woman he is sneaking around with before the thought police can find them , the Exogenesis Cycle wondering how and when will this world end , `` the United States of Euroasia \'\' with its a `` Queen-like \'\' anthem in it with a Chopin Nocturne with bombs going off in the background . It is incredible , and even more incredible that Matthew Bellamy is playing the classical piano like a maestro , sticks a Saint Saens excerpt in the middle of `` I belong to you \'\' , and can sing an impressive Falsetto in `` Exogenis Part I . \'\' If you listen to the album as a whole , it will tell you a story , and you realize that you ca n\'t just listen to one song . This album is not like any Radiohead that i have ever heard , and in fact that is why I did n\'t like Muse back around 1999-2000 when they were first coming out . I thought that they were trying to mimic Radiohead , and being a Rabbid Radiohead fan that I am , I did n\'t want to buy any of their albums . That is until I heard the song Supermassive Black Hole . This album does n\'t sound like Radiohead , and I think this is Muse \'s new voice in the music world ; it shows they are serious musicians and ready to come into their own . Screw it if it is n\'t radio-friendly . If that \'s what you care about then do n\'t buy this cd because it is not just a Fluff listen while you are doing something else . Listen to this album and read the lyrics . I love 1984 , and this is about the best rendition or homage I have heard or seen . Crack open a bottle of wine , take out your headphones , light a candle and lay back and enjoy . I have n\'t stopped ',normal

I switched off the brush bar and looked in the end , nothing was wrong . I called customer service and after about 15 minutes on the phone with them figured out it was working properly . What the heck ? I expected this thing to suck so hard that it would lift the carpet and create perfecty groomed rows of nap ... like a freshly plowed field . Not even close it barely even combed the top of the fibers . Problem # 1-No height adjustment for the brush bar . It barely even touches the carpet .

578,15_14_R121GB30BXP2DT.txt,' I actually could not decide between the Garmin Nuvi 255w or the 750 model , so I decided to buy them both for comparison . I mounted them both to my car windshield and gave them various addresses to find together . I found that both models took the same routes and announced upcoming turns and street names at practically the same time . One thing I noticed about the 255w was that it was updating my position on the road more often , I \'d say about 3 times as often as the 750 . This made for smoother graphics on the 255w of the vehicle moving along displayed roads , where the 750 \'s display was more of a `` jerky \'\' movement . I also found that the display on the 255w was a bit brighter , clearer , and more vivid than on the 750 in both daylight and at night . Another feature I like on the 255w is the graphic turn indicator in the upper left corner , which the 750 lacks . This is a small arrow which shows upcoming turns and the distance to that turn . It also show things like a fork in the road , ( ie : a Y intersection ) , and which fork you will be taking . The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow . It \'s just a little extra feature on the 255w which I happened to really like . The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit . Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed . I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance . The 750 does n\'t have this feature . I also like how they moved the zoom in ( + ) and zoom out ( - ) buttons on the 255w to the same side of the screen which makes it a bit easier . On the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen . Now there are some features on the 750 that the 255w does not have . The 750 can broadcast it \'s sound over your FM radio with the supplied cigarette lighter cable , and it has a headphone jack , which I found to be nice features . The 750 also has an MP3 player and an Audio-book player , which the 255w does not . Another really nice feature of the 750 is the car locater . This is a great feature if you are parking in a really big lot , such as at an amusement park or a fair . The 750 marks your location when you remove it from the car , then you take it with you and it remembers where you parked and takes you right back to your car . The 255w does n\'t have the car locater . I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w \'s . The 750 sounds more like a real female voice , where the 255w sounds more robotic . Another thing to consider was that I paid $ 50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads . My final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators . I did n\'t find a need for the 750 \'s MP3 player and Audio book player , but that is up to personal preference . Since the USB cable was not included with the 255w , I purchased it on this site for $ 10 . I also intend to purchase the MSN direct cable when it is available in August 2008 . ',normal
579,36_9_R1V3CD3WQFT5S7.txt,' & quot ; It is a sin to kill a mockingbird. & quot ; This book is about justice , and conscience ... it is about race , and bigotry ... it is about courage , and cowardice ... it is about values of the family , and the culture ... it is about humanity . The novel speaks through the 8-year-old voice of Scout Finch , the youngest child of a widower , Atticus Finch . There are two stories being told . One story is about Scout , her older brother Jem and their summertime friend Dill Harris as they pass three summers together in a small town in Alabama , when they focused much of their energy on a reclusive , neighbor , Boo Radley . The other story is about the trial of Tom Robinson , a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1930 \'s Alabama . Atticus is appointed to represent the accused .

586,1_7_R1V1O60V01GACW.txt,' To tell the truth , I was n\'t looking forward to this film at all . I \'m a pretty big fan of most of Kevin Smith \'s work , but he did n\'t write the film . It could be argued that he did write Jersey Girl and that could be considered a bomb , but his films usually average about $ 25- $ 30 million anyway . A Kevin Smith film is n\'t really about bringing in a large amount of money at the box office . His charm is in his writing , especially the dialogue and interaction between characters . There \'s a very specific audience his films will appeal to and none of them have really branched away from that . But him not writing this one made me think , `` Eh . Not sure what that \'ll be like since he did n\'t write it . \'\' When it comes to Bruce Willis , I \'ve never talked to anyone who dislikes him entirely . There always seems to be at least one of his films everybody enjoys . Die Hard , The Fifth Element , and Sin City are just a few off the top of my head . The real buzzkiller for me though was Tracy Morgan . He \'s just never been funny to me . He was beyond lame on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock has never been able to hold my attention for very long . Not to mention all the trailers for Cop Out did n\'t make me laugh . Thankfully though , first impressions can be so very wrong . One of Cop Out \'s biggest charms is that it feels like a buddy cop comedy you \'ve seen before , but have forgotten how much you enjoy it . The film feels similar to a 48 Hrs or Beverly Hills Cop film . Bulletproof is also a good example . Cop Out is pretty much what you expect when it comes to roles Bruce Willis chooses as it \'s pretty much no different than his role as John McClane on the surface , but he \'s a lot funnier this time around . As far as Tracy Morgan goes , the funniest thing I could remember him saying was his one line in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ( `` Man ... I do n\'t know what the f -- - you just said , Little Kid , but you \'re special man , you reached out , and you touched a brother \'s heart . \'\' ) until this film . He was downright hilarious at times . The only person who was funnier than Morgan was Seann William Scott who stole every scene he was in . Even though Kevin Smith did n\'t pen the script this time around , it still feels like a Kevin Smith film . It could be due to the fact that Jason Lee has a small role in the film , but I like to think it \'s because Cop Out offers the same kind of comedy you \'d find in a Kevin Smith film with a bit more action . It also took me forever to place Scarface from Half Baked as Poh Boy . Cop Out is surprisingly funny and incredibly entertaining . Give this film a chance even if the trailers may not be doing anything for you . I felt the same way and wound up thoroughly enjoying the film . After a long , stressful day at work , an R-rated comedy with a lot of laughs is one of the best ways to relax and this film offers just that . It \'s a great film to go into with no expectations other than to just have a good time . As long as you do n\'t run out of the theater , you should catch the part in the credits . This might just be the funniest film released in 2010 thus far . Be sure to check it out . Highly recommended . ',normal

I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way . I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like `` Lord of the Rings \'\' . I ca n\'t say if that \'s accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of `` Lord of the Rings \'\' . I was scared , I mean REALLY scared that Burton , even with Depp and the rest of the cast would n\'t be able to pull this off . I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch . It did n\'t . In a sea of weird movies , this one has to be Burton \'s crowing jewel of weirdness . If you thought `` Charlie and the Chocolate Factory \'\' was weird , you have n\'t seen ANYTHING . This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100 . Is that a good thing ? It depends ..... Did you like `` Charlie \'\' ? If the answer is yes , than you \'ll probably like this . I liked `` Charlie \'\' but I though this was a hundred times weirder and better . Ok .... \'\' Alice in Wonderland \'\' . What was good ? Masterfull acting from Depp , Carter , and Hathaway . Burton \'s most visually stunning movie ever . Great score . The film was paced well and was n\'t a second too long or too short . I know a lot of people were worried that the CGI would ruin the movie . It did n\'t , it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other . Some may say Avatar , but I have n\'t seen that yet so I really ca n\'t compare . What was bad ? There really was n\'t a whole lot of story to be had here . It had A story just not a very deep one . What little story was there was good and it wrapped up very nicely . I \'m knocking one star off due to lack of a more in depth story . But considering I never knew what the original story was to begin with I really ca n\'t complain . Let \'s sum it up . Burton \'s most visually stunning film ever . The entire cast is amazingly good . Everything is perfect in every way except the story could have used a little more work . I saw the movie in 2D not 3D but I loved the 2D version .

594,2_4_R1VBE1OYWCK92V.txt,' The Nintendo Wii has been stated by many to have revolutionized gaming as we know it . A drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology . A claim , that I believed as well . The idea of playing games with motions is intriguing , enticing , and exciting , something that many use as a decision maker when it comes time to purchase a console . I was one of the many people who waited in line all night November 18 , 2006 for the Nintendo Wii . After taking it home that first morning , I was dying from anticipation of playing the newest console made by Nintendo . I opened the console , I liked what I saw . The Wii Menu is unique , and is a great way to navigate the console . The menu displays the contents of the Wii \'s internal hard-drive , displaying items such as downloaded games , and new channels that may have been purchased . Navigating the menu requires the usage of the sensor bar and pointing the Wii Remote at the screen to choose the desired channel . The games feel unique at first , requiring motions to control on screen avatars within the games . However , as time goes by , the feeling of revolution is replaced with tedium . After a few hours of gameplay it becomes obvious that button presses of the past have simply been replaced with simple gestures that do not represent the actual on screen action . For example : in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press `` A \'\' but the Wii replaces this with a simple `` shake \'\' of the controller . It does n\'t even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either , seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions . The majority of the games on the Wii really only use five different gestures , simply recycled over and over again . These gestures include : shake controller left , shake controller right , shake controller up , shake controller down , and thrust controller forward . These gestures do not actually allow the gamer to feel immersed in the game , since these gestures are no different than button pressing . The added drawback of these motions is the inaccuracy of the detection of them as well . Where I started to lose faith in the Wii was after picking up some hardcore games for the console . I began by purchasing Resident Evil 4 , Okami , Madworld , No More Heroes , Mortal Kombat Armageddon , Dragonball Z Tenkaichi 2 and 3 , Twilight Princess , and more . I started to realize that with these games , precision is an absolute must . However , the Wii remote \'s motion controller actually takes away from the precision due to the poor detection skills of the controller . This results in lag , delayed moves , incorrect moves , and more . In several of these games , I found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the Wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves . For example : in Twilight Princess , the shield bash is done by pushing the nunchuk forward , however , sometimes this registered as the nunchuk being moved to the side which corresponds with a spin attack . Similar scenarios began to play out with all of the Wii games I purchased . Every game began to get more frustrating and I began to play my Playstation 3 more and more . Finally , I came to a conclusion , traditional controls just work better for playing games , period . The graphics of the Wii are fine , in my opinion , despite the lack of HD . Graphics alone do not make a game fun , and that is why I continue to play PSOne and Nintendo 64 games to this day . However , the unresponsive controller gestures of the Wii are enough to turn me away from the console . I \'m still hoping that Microsoft and Sony do n\'t try to follow Nintendo too much with motion control gameplay seeing as it actually makes games more difficult and frustrating to play . If you \'re a gamer looking for a console with great games , is a lot of fun , and can be played for hours on end with full precision and control , do n\'t go with the Wii . You ca n\'t go wrong with either a PS3 or a 360 though , both offer a wide variety of games in every genre and both respond the way you tell them to . The Wii may have enough perks to attract you if you stick to games such as Super Smash Bros Brawl , Guilty Gear and other games that allow the option of playing with either a classic remote or a GameCube controller , but not enough games give players this option . Also , if you \'re not looking for games that contain in depth controls , than perhaps you will do just fine with the Wii . The Wii has its ups , and its downs , but for me personally , it has been a disappointment . ',ironisch
595,26_11_R2PJCVB3FPT2V8.txt,' Avril Lavigne has changed a lot , in my opinion , since `` Let Go \'\' . But I think those changes were made for the better . Not only do her songs have less cheesy lines in them , but you can tell just by looking at her that she is more mature . I found this album to be a little depressing because there are n\'t too many cheerful , upbeat songs like there were on Let Go , but still a cool pop/rock album ! Here are my ratings for each song : 1 . Take Me Away-5/5 . This song has a hard rock beat , and is somewhat like `` Losing Grip \'\' , the song that started off Let Go . It is about just wanting to get away from all the pain and suffering being felt inside . 2 . Together-4/5 . Avril \'s vocals in the chorus have a rather annoingly high pitch , but this song is still a good one . In this song , Avril talks about not feeling `` together \'\' with her boyfriend . 3 . Do n\'t Tell Me-5/5 . One of my favorite songs on this album . It has a rather mature subject , and is not exactly the most appropriate for younger kids . 4 . He Wasn\'t-3/5 . The `` Sk8r Boi \'\' of Under My Skin , `` He Was n\'t \'\' is really upbeat , and the lyrics are kind of cheesy in some parts . In this song , Avril sings about the boy she likes turning out to be someone completely different from what she thought he would be . 5 . How Does It Feel-3/5 . This song is slow , but Avril \'s vocals sound pretty good in it . That \'s why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 . It is about wondering how other people view the world . 6 . My Happy Ending-5/5 . Another of my favorites on this album . It has a great beat , and catchy lyrics . It is about an `` UN-Happy Ending \'\' with a boy . Note that there is a kind of big cussword in the part after the first chorus . 7 . Nobody \'s Home-4/5 . I guess this is the song I should be talking about the most , since Amazon wo n\'t let you listen to a clip of it on this album . It is a kind of sad song about a girl who \'s been misguided , and who is alone and depressed . The beat is good , and Avril \'s voice sounds nice . 8 . Forgotten-5/5 . This song starts out in an eerie sort of way , then turns into hard rock and loud vocals . This is yet another of my favorite songs . It is about , of course , being forgotten and left behind . 9. Who Knows-3/5 . This song has a good beat , and is about making your dreams come true . 10 . Fall To Pieces-3/5 . This song is slightly better then `` Who Knows \'\' , in my opinion , although it sounds rather similar to it . It is a love song , and Avril \'s vocals sound pretty good in it . 11 . Freak Out-5/5 . This song sounds like one that would end a really good movie , or be the favorite on the movie soundtrack . It has a good beat , and catchy lyrics . I used to not like it , but yes , it is now ANOTHER of my favorite songs on this album . It is about letting loose . 12 . Slipped Away-5/5 . This is a sad song Avril wrote about when her grandpa died . The beat is nice , though slow , the lyrics are good , and Avril \'s vocals sound great . If you \'re easily depressed/disturbed then you might not like this song , though . By averaging , I got the overall rating of 4 stars for this album , which is better then the overall rating I got for Let Go . I would suggest listening to clips of the songs here on Amazon before purchasing , though . ',normal
596,39_17_R12EPKTNS75T7V.txt,' This is a rather unusual book , one that takes a clever approach of seeking to understand Bush Junior in the context of a Shakespearian tragedy , and specifically , Henry V . Here are my flyleaf notes -- this is a totally worthy book by a real professional with insight . + Three myths of the House of Bush : - Made it on my own - Not really rich - Running for office to serve the Nation + Seven Lessons from the House of Bush - Treachery of the press - Importance of moment - Money before politics - Primacy of manners - NE moderates an endangered species - Do n\'t give up - Trust only the family + The author opens early with his conclusion that George Junior is a Walker ( the differences are explained ) , not a Bush and the rest of the book is a lovely explanation of a family tragedy in three acts : - ACT I : the loser struggling to be like Dad and failing - ACT II : success at being different ( drunk , boorish , inept , but different ) - ACT III : descent into mesianism ( what happens when a village idiot gets the illusion of power ) + Early on I have a note : national and global catastrophe rooted in a broken family whose black sheep got promoted more than one rung too far . It must gall the second fiddle that his own mother does not like him and thought the Presidency should have gone to Jeb . + Despite my extensive reading on the last eight years of high crimes and misdemeanors , this book contains information I have not seen before . The author hits the reader early on with : - Rove , Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Rice were `` enablers \'\' for George Juniors \' idiocy ( Powell in my view confused loyalty with integrity ) - The second term flame-out was avoidable -- Bush had good intentions but Rove held sway + The author addresses Bush \'s faith as false , non-theological , more like `` self-help Methodism , \'\' using Alcoholics Anonymous meetings instead of church as a group activity . + There is a superb discussion of the juxtaposition of Bush \'s linguistic blunders combined with the manner in which he was gifted at using evangelical and conservative code words . + There is fine coverage of George Juniors meanness and overbearing humiliating toward all , Rove in particular , who accepted every humiliation , including the nickname `` Turd Blossom . \'\' + The author summarizes the scandals on Rove \'s watch : Plume , Katrina , Iraq , firing of prosecutors ( I would also add , subversion of Congress in violation of Article one , see Breach of Trust and also Broken Branch ) . + We learn in passing that Rove was abandoned three times : - By his father who ran away - By his stepfather who ran away ( one of the two was homosexual , I forget which ) - By his mother who committed suicide + It was Rove , the author tells us , who pushed privatization of social security . As I review this book there are ads on the radio that seek to communicate that 40 \% of America \'s shares are owned by normal people . What they do not tell you , which you can lean in John Bogle \'s book , The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism , is that we are no longer an ownership society , we have abdicated to financial management intermediaries , and they have skimmed one fifth of the value off for themselves , a select few . + According to the author it was Rove and not George Junior that pressed for a strategy of demonizing terrorism . The author says Rove destroyed the Bush II presidency with the `` catastrophic blunder of politicizing the War on Terror . \'\' + When the author finally gets around to covering Dick Cheney he casts him perfectly as `` Lord Chief Justice \'\' from Henry V , the sycophant who revels in pulling the strings behind the scenes . I have the line , my own interpretation of the author \'s words , `` played Bush like a fiddle . \'\' + The author asserts that Cheney was not transformed , as Brent Scowcroft believes , but rather finally found an opportunity to exercise his own judgment about the irrelevance of Congress and the need for a unilateral Presidency autonomous from oversight and able to take bold initiatives without consultation . [ See One Percent Doctrine for a review of Cheney \'s mal ; feasance going back to the Ford Presidency , in ursurping Presidential power ] . + The author , editor in chief of Slate , observes that the press really missed this about Cheney , his intent focus on expanding Presidential power and dismissing Article 1 of the Constitution . + The author reminds us that Cheney went from intern to Chief of Staff of the White House in 6 years , and I can not help wondering what pathologies came from too much power too soon ( see The Pathology of Power - A Challenge to Human Freedom and Safety ) + Addington receives concise but chilling coverage . + Pages 170-171 are a priceless summary of how Cheney - Managed Bush \'s mind - Framed choices - Accelerated Bush \'s neurotic shoot from the hip uninformed decision making ( while ensuring behind that Cheney \'s decision was preset or , if necessary , counter-manding the President behind his back after the fact , alleging to others not in a position to question , that President had changed his mind ) . + The author discovered in Lynn Cheney \'s `` Executive Privilege \'\' ( evidently no longer carried by Amazon ) a telling fictional tale all too real . + The section I found most interesting outlined the six phases of Bush Doctrine : - 1.0 Unipolar Realism ( we make reality in our own image ) - 2.0 With us or Against Us - 3.0 Preemptive attack - 4.0 Democracy in the Middle East - 5.0 Freedom Everywhere - 6.0 No doctrine at all + The author surprises me with one defense of Cheney that I consider credible : Cheney truly wanted to vaccinate the entire nation against smallpox because he truly believed the threat existed . I am reminded of Daniel Elsberg who in Secrets : A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers recounts how he warned Henry Kissinger that reliance on Top Secret Codeword information would `` make him like a moron , unable to listen to those who actually know . \'\' + The author tells us that Bush II reads books many of them `` but does not know how to think historically . \'\' I am reminded of my youngest son , 12 years old , a brilliant wide receiver and first baseman , who at this point can read a book and not remember a thing from the plot . + The author ends with a devastating comparison of Winston Churchill , who did outgrow Lord Randolph and make his mark , and George Junior who `` in the end , ... failed to be his own man or displace his father . \'\' Naturally there is the humiliating irony of proving that his father was right not to have gone on to Baghdad . I just shake my head wondering how the American people have been so silent . Here are a few other books that round out the catastrophic decrepitude of the Bush-Cheney regime : Vice : Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency Weapons of Mass Deception : The Uses of Propaganda in Bush \'s War on Iraq Breach of Trust : How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders Running On Empty : How The Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It A Pretext for War : 9/11 , Iraq , and the Abuse of America \'s Intelligence Agencies Losing America : Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency Some time a go I wrote a piece on 9/11 , `` who \'s to blame , \'\' and it boiled down to this : We the People are to blame , for having dropped out of the democracy and abdicated our civic responsibilities . Cheney \'s high crimes and misdemeanors , not least of which was letting 9/11 happen as FDR let Pearl Harbor happen , Congress abdicating its Article 1 responsibilities , the mainstream media refusing $ 100,000 fully paid ads against the war ; a piss-ant like Wolfowitz being able to get away with questioning Shinseki \'s experience , insight , and honor -- all of these are secondary causes and I would hasten to include the `` failure of generalship , \'\' flag officer who , like Colin Powell , forgot their Oath of Office and confused loyalty with integrity . The prime cause is that we gave our government over to what I now consider to be four organized crime families : the Clintons , the Bushes , the Democratic Party , and the Republican Party . As McCaffrey said on CNN last night ( 13 Feb 08 ) , `` anyone who votes for an incumbent in 2008 should lose their American citizenship . \'\' Tongue in cheek ? Perhaps . Relevant and actionable ? Absolutely . It \'s time to abolish this government and start over . ',normal
597,6_14_R1GVEI41Q75EYH.txt,' First of all , full disclosure requires that I mention that I helped copy edit this book for the publisher . This means that I have a very thorough knowledge of the contents of the book . This book is not for * everyone * who plays massively multi-player online ( MMO ) games , but is instead designed specifically for those who are -- or are curious about becoming -- leaders and officers of guilds , those organized groups that are the lifeblood of MMOs . The book covers a very wide gamut within this topic , but the main take-away is that this book is helpful for ANYONE interested in guild leadership . Those who are wondering what is involved in starting and leading a guild will find a lot of information about how to create a new guild from scratch , while those who are already officers or leaders will find a lot of helpful information for topics like how to deal with churn , personality conflicts , or drama . The author includes numerous examples -- many by way of personal experience -- that make it easy for the reader to see how policies or situations may apply in a real in-game situation . Best of all , the author takes great care to ensure that this book is about the role of guild leadership in all MMOs ; this is not a book about how to be a guild leader in any one specific game ( that is , you wo n\'t feel left out that you are a guild leader in a smaller MMO instead of a behemoth like World of Warcraft ) . The book is organized in a way that readers can easily go directly to a section and gather practical information , and in that way . Readers should get just as much out of this by picking a specific section to read , as if they sat down and read the book cover to cover . I see this book as both a cookbook for guild leadership ( that is , identifying and finding a particular topic that applies to your situation and looking up solutions ) , as well as a disaster prevention/management book for how to ensure that your guild runs smoothly . All in all , this is a highly detailed and unique book that should be very helpful for both current guild leaders and officers , as well as those interested in what is involved in running a guild . If you \'re feeling generous , consider getting this for your guild leader . ',normal

604,41_19_R120PWEW3BJRRA.txt,' I am the author of Striking It Rich : Golf in the Kingdom with Generals , Patients and Pros As someone who generally reviews things I like ( I reviewed `` Rushmore \'\' but passed on `` I Heart Huchabees \'\' and `` Lost in Translation \'\' ) I am a little uncomfortable doing this review . I was a physics major at MIT and spent 2 years counting cards in Vegas and Reno after graduation . I was 21 when I started ; the same age as the protagonist . I eventually tired of the card-counting lifestyle and went on to medical school . Chapter 3 in my book is entitled `` The World \'s Biggest ATM \'\' . Its all about card-counting and my time at MIT . So I consider myself to be something of an expert on the subject matter in `` 21 \'\' . Nothing is portrayed even close to reality in this movie . First of all , card counting itself is not that hard . Any student who can get into MIT can learn to count cards . Its not that mathematical either ( in the Thorpe tens/non-tens system you have to do some quick division in your head but they were using a -1 , 0 , +1- type of system where you only have to add -1 , 0 or +1 as each card is played ) . OK You have to have a good memory and be able to focus intensely without anyone noticing what you are doing . I happen to have a good memory . You probably do too . It took me three weeks of learning the tables and practicing to become enough of an expert to be able to play in the casino for hours on end without making a mistake . And in case you \'re wondering ... YES it works , But it is a job . With the systems now available , you can get an advantage of 2 or 3 percent over the house ( the casino ) . It does n\'t sound like much but if you play 100 hands per 60 minute hour at an average of $ 100 per hand , you have created $ 10,000 of `` action \'\' . 3 \% of that is $ 300 . Per hour . And that \'s about how it works . To get $ 3,000 per day ( more than $ 1 million per year ) you have to play 10 hours ; or you have to bet more . I played with my own money and needed to play with less at the beginning because you need enough of a bankroll ( about 200 x your minimum bet ) to make sure an unfortunate run of cards does n\'t wipe you out . And unfortunate runs you do get at times . You only average $ 300 per hour in my example ; sometimes you make more , sometimes less . It \'s a fairly tedious undertaking that pays off gradually with time , time and more time at the tables . I wanted to love this movie- both subjects are near and dear to my heart- but I had heard that the book was n\'t accurate either and I was n\'t expecting too much . Even so , the movie ( and book too- I eventually read it ) fell far short of my low expectations . MIT was n\'t portrayed accurately at all , starting with the two idiotic friends . That may be the characarture of MIT but it is n\'t anything like MIT . In my time there I never met anyone like that . The protagonist was pretty typical , nothing unusual in his abilities or background as MIT standards go . The Kevin Spacey character could never exist ; talking to another professor to get the kid out of an exam and give him an A . What ! ? And the casino scenes ; oh the casino scenes ... Those idiotic hand signals ? C\'mon , the cocktail waitresses would \'ve picked up on those ... Lawrence Fishbourne beating the tar out of people he caught counting ! ? I do n\'t think so . The Nevada State Gaming Commission would shut ` em down , pronto . ( Getting caught cheating the casino with a dealer or by marking the cards , etc.- that might be different ) . But counting cards IS N\'T ILLEGAL . Its not against the rules to use your brain . In 2 years of playing on a regular basis ( the casinos even pay for your flights and hotel rooms ! ) and sporadically after that- it really is addictive- nobody ever caught me counting ; except once . That time , they just asked us to leave . They said we were disturbing the patrons . `` Gladly \'\' , we said , and just walked down the street to the next casino . Part of the problem with the movie is that its hard to make an entire movie about counting . There \'s just not enough material for a theatrical full-length feature film . ( Its much more ideally-suited to a one hour documentary . ) Ok , so what to do ? Enter the two stupid friends and the side show about the 2.09 contest , the strip-joint girls cashing in the chips , ( I do n\'t think so- a few of them might slip into the ladies room never to be seen again ) , the sob story about needing the money for medical school , etc . `` Excuse me Mr. Future Doctor Millionaire , MIT math genius , Harvard Med Graduate , do n\'t take your mom \'s life savings , do n\'t lie about the scholarship , just apply for a student loan like everyone else who \'s going to medical school . \'\' That \'s why it occupies only one of thirty-six chapters in my book . There \'s just not that much to the mechanics of counting and making it work in the casinos . The magic in counting cards is in the realization that it is a free ticket to as much money as you will ever want and that you will never have to work again . A `` free \'\' ticket ? Not exactly . It turns out to be a job like any other . I made that clear in `` Striking It Rich \'\' and I too eventually went to medical school and became a surgeon . Who wants to count cards all day when they could do something useful ( and if it matters to you ) make the same amount of money in the process ? Counting cards , MIT math geniuses , the very pretty female protagonist , etc . are all potentially sexy subjects but their sexiness was utterly lost in this book/movie . Where were the consultants who knew something about MIT ? Casinos ? One of our fine actors , Kevin Spacey , was a producer on this film . How could he let this happen ? What were Spacey and the writers thinking ? Nix the idiotic characterization of the kid who was making hundreds of thousands counting yet who insisted on stealing everything from bottles of booze to pens from the maid cart , and the entire team who was scared to try it without Spacey \'s corrupt professor at the helm ... Uh , HELLO ? - these are supposed to be our best and brightest , Mr. Producers ... ) A realistic portrayal of MIT students and of MIT , and of casino card counting could have been something very entertaining . As a lover of MIT , movies , card-counting , money , sexy , smart women , etc. , all I could think was `` What a waste ! \'\' ',ironisch
605,34_4_RNI9VWP5GIW1D.txt,' I \'ve really loved all the previous Jenny Cain mysteries by Nancy Pickard ( with the exception of BUM STEER , which wandered all the way across the country from the New England setting ) . Nearly all are witty , wise and well-written , satisfying all three of the `` Important W \'s \'\' of popular fiction . In all the other Jenny Cain novels , even BUM STEER , the plotting is tight , the characters plausible , and although clues are dropped along the way , the conclusions are n\'t easy for a reader to figure out . TWILIGHT \'s chief problem is that it \'s a clumsy mystery . Even the characterization seems weak in this book , and Jenny is by no means at her interesting , clever best . Even distracted by the Autumn Festival , how could she have misinterpreted Bill \'s odd behavior and remarks as `` funny \'\' when readers immediately know that something is wrong with his perception of reality ? And the main plot -- the hazards of an urban hiking trial crossing a road for vehicles -- makes a mountain out of a molehill . It \'s unworthy of Ms. Pickard \'s doubtless gifts as a writer , since the persons who should have been consulted on the issue of road safety apparently never were when the trail was created -- namely , state , county , and insurance safety engineers . My father was a safety engineer , who would have taken about one afternoon to recommend answers to the hazards of that fatal road crossing . There must be quite a few safety specialists in Massachusetts since , when I lived in New England back in the 60s , there were plenty of road signs . There were also hiking trails , many of which crossed paved roads . Did n\'t Nancy Pickard ever hear of multiple signs warning of pedestrian crossings ? Of blinking red lights ? Ordinary stop signs at the bottom of the grade , on both sides of the trail , would have prevented every one of the fatalities caused by the carelessness of a person who seemed not to wander from his own yard and driveway . Look , I live in Philadelphia . We have a long woodsy hiking trail winding along a scenic creek with urban neighborhoods on either side . Going from the Chestnut Hill neighbohood to the Andorra neighborhood , a heavily trafficked road crosses this trail -- and vice-versa . This crossing is protected by stop signs , and elswehere by traffic overpasses . Urban trails are , of course , inherently somewhat unsafe . The trails in Philly are sometimes stalked by muggers and rapists , but if any hiker has been killed by a vehicle in the seven years I \'ve lived in Philly I \'ve never heard of it . I \'m sorry that the Jenny Cain series is at an end , but perhaps Ms. Pickard realized that something went wrong with this book . I just wish Jenny had gone out like a lioness . ',ironisch
1243,40_15_R233HVRAS6F7IC.txt,' This book is sure to be loudly denounced and vehemently derided , but coming , as it does , from a member of Clinton \'s own military security detail , it will most likely never be debunked .

611,46_15_R2O6Z5V4R0B9L.txt,' I open this review with a very strong piece of advice : please listen to this album in its entirety . Then come back to it within a day or two ( or sooner , if you are so inclined ) and give it a second listen from beginning to end . If you do that , unless you really dislike `` this kind of music \'\' , I \'m relatively certain you will be enchanted with the album permanently . Plastic Beach is truly an amazing work . Keep the following thoughts in mind as you navigate through other reviews of Plastic Beach . First , immediately discount any that express disillusion that this album is not the sequel to its stellar predecessor , Demon Days ( 2005 ) . Comparisons to Demon Days ( and , by extension , the 2001 self-titled debut album ) are useful to the extent they allow you to see how the Gorillaz sound has evolved over the course of a decade . To truly appreciate this work fairly , however , you should judge it on the strength of its own merits . Moreover , this review is being written the day of its United States release , and there are currently a handful of reviews that rate the album poorly . These reviews seem to have a few things in common : they show very little regard to not only the craftsmanship and genius behind this work , but seem to be written from a jaded aspect that belies someone writing against a deadline and only taking time to listen to the album once ( if they even listened that much ) . That said , while this album is n\'t perfection personified , it really is quite good , easily earning a 9 out of 10 rating . Below I will grade each track individually , but first I want to address the album as a whole . Clocking in at just under an hour , this album is a cohesive whole that takes you on a sonic journey full of unlikely sights and stops along the way ( often even within the individual songs themselves ) . It \'s not surprising that this album in its formative stages was originally named `` Carousel \'\' by its loving architect , musical wizard Damon Albarn . The album is a special kind of ride . At times the album makes you think , but not too hard , because it does n\'t purport to take a stand on any of the issues it brings to the surface . Other times the album makes you want to sing along , but not too loudly , because you want to be able to appreciate the artistry at work in each song . Most importantly , the album makes you feel emotion . Whether it be exhilaration , abandon , wonderment , or disquiet , you feel it with force . On to the snapshots of each song in the US track-list . 1 ) Orchestral Intro -- 4/5 This track lets you know you are headed somewhere important and maybe just a little bit different . If you listen closely , the fade-out carries a hint of distortion , which I take as an indication that the nature you are about to experience is quite unnatural . 2 ) Welcome to The World of The Plastic Beach -- 3/5 There \'s probably no truer living representation of hip-hop than Snoop Dogg , and he serves as an apropos master of ceremonies welcoming you to your destination . Snoop has always had a unique five-star flow , and it \'s on full display on this track . Ever since his debut album Doggystyle ( 1993 ) , however , he has an uneven track-record of bringing the heat to whatever song he \'s spitting rhymes on . The frustrating thing about Snoop is that both the listener and he are in on the fact that many times he is as lazy a lyricist as the flow of his trademark delivery , and that is indeed the case in this song , using trite expressions like `` Boss Dogg \'\' ( not once , but twice ) , `` mirror , mirror on the wall \'\' and `` crack-a-lackin \'\' . For the record , my wife thinks that Snoop did exactly what he was supposed to do on this track : introduce , not steal the stage . Regardless , aided by the sick horns of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble , this song helps get you in the mood to groove . 3 ) White Flag -- 3/5 A light , flighty orchestral piece by the Lebanese National Orchestra For Oriental and Arabic Music ( I think I got that right ... ) takes you to Bollywood and some other exotic places you \'ve probably never been to as you skip across the sand of Plastic Beach for the first time . You are suddenly greeted by a hot potato back-and-forth rap between British grime rap stars Kano and Bashy set to a dub beat . Their wordplay forms the musical meat sandwiched between the previously mentioned beginning of the track and its conclusion , which is a synthesis of the orchestral part and the dub beat . The final outcome is both an unlikely treat and treatise from your locale . 4 ) Rhinestone Eyes -- 5/5 This song has video single written all over it . 2D \'s vocals take center stage for the first time . It \'s a heavily synthesized pop tune complete with catchy not-quite-a-chorus repeats of the phrase `` Love Electric-tric-tric-tric-tric \'\' that you can only imagine yourself chanting alongside Noodle . This song also carries that signature `` Gorillaz sound \'\' of keyboards and drumbeats that can be traced back to their debut album . This song is definitely one of the reasons I regard the album so highly . 5 ) Stylo -- 5/5 The lead single and video from the album . `` Feel Good , Inc. \'\' it is not , but this fact only adds to `` Stylo \'\' \'s charm . An unyielding beat accentuated by an insidious , haunting repetition of the phrase `` Overload \'\' , a slick verse from Mos Def , and the undeniable raw power of Bobby Womack make this song an instant classic . You do n\'t get `` Stylo \'\' at first , you just know it has a catchy beat . After multiple listens , though , you realize the song is consummate . It is worth mentioning that essential to the whole Gorillaz concept is the fact that their music is both an audio and visual experience . Taken in that light , the promotional video shot for this track by co-creator Jaime Hewlett does an excellent job of immediately engaging the audience and drawing them into Plastic Beach . 6 ) Superfast Jellyfish -- 4/5 Rumored to be the second video and single from the album , this song is dripping with sinister irony . De La Soul become the first rap artists to score a follow-up opportunity with the Gorillaz , and they do not disappoint in this twisted indictment of consumerism , cloaked in a breakfast meal jingle . Though not as in-your-face and extreme as , say , Johnathan Swift \'s 1729 pamphlet `` A Modest Proposal \'\' the implications of this song are meant to be frightening . Gruff Rhys also lends his vocals to the track that is both scary and scary good . 7 ) Empire Ants -- 5/5 The beautiful , peaceful beginning of this song shows Plastic Beach at its most serene . The guitar makes a rare appearance , and it strums blissfully along in concert with 2D \'s singing and piano accompaniment . Then , halfway through , the song it improbably explodes into a shimmering disco-pop tune completed by the vocals of Yukumi Nagano from the Swedish group , Little Dragon . This may very well be the album \'s best song , though `` Broken \'\' gives it a serious run for its money a few songs later . 8 ) Glitter Freeze -- 2/5 Personal preference here , but this is my least favorite song of the lot . Mostly instrumental with a few sparse words from curmudgeon Mark E Smith , this song is an aural assault on your eardrums and mind . Often , after this song ends , I \'m relieved , because it feels like I \'ve just been willingly violated , which might just be a microcosm for one of the tenets of the album , namely the willful violation of our own home planet . But just as soon as you begin to contemplate that we are off to our next song . 9 ) Some Kind of Nature -- 3/5 Many are split on this Lou Reed guest effort , where his sing-song voice takes Albarn \'s piano-based beatnik ditty for a quick spin . Some hail it as the watermark of Plastic Beach , while others decry it as its nadir . The song comes pre-loaded with a fully realized chorus and simulated clapping that beckons singing along . I \'m still not sure what to make of it all , I find myself in neither of the previously mentioned camps of supporters or naysayers , but I believe it is a solid addition to the album regardless . 10 ) On Melancholy Hill -- 5/5 An endearing track . Listen closely and you \'ll hear a rhythm that lies beneath Coldplay \'s `` Viva La Vida \'\' and the song it borrowed heavily from `` Foreigner Suite \'\' by Cat Stevens . I doubt it is intentional , and it is otherwise completely overshadowed by what is quite an uncharacteristically upbeat , almost saccharine ode from Albarn . While this song is technically 2D from Gorillaz , it is also every bit just Damon being himself . 11 ) Broken -- 5/5 My favorite of the album . The song evokes Clint Eastwood with its pseudo-riff on `` The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly \'\' theme by Hugo Montenegro . The song is beyond phenomenal , and I think this is no coincidence , another 2D solo joint that can just as easily be seen as Damon Albarn as himself . The beat is seriously sick and haunting at the same time . The production sounds as if lifted off a top-flight hip-hop producer \'s private instrumental songbook , but it is so much more due to Damon \'s vocals dominating the song . I do n\'t care what he is singing about in this song , I just want to listen and feel his lament . It \'s why this album , and its creator , are one-of-a-kind . 12 ) Sweepstakes -- 4/5 Hated this song at first , due to the repetition of the beat and the rhyme . However , keep listening : the lyrics actually change , not in their content , but in their delivery , just as the song itself transforms into something greater than the sum of its parts . Several minutes of repetition in , you are greeted again by the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble amplified this time with a percussion section that evokes an American college football halftime band performance . Mos Def is most definitely a winner on this track . Hip-hop heads will prefer this track to the rest of the album \'s offerings , which speaks to the fact that there is almost something for everyone here . 13 ) Plastic Beach -- 3/5 I ca n\'t hear Mick Jones \' contribution to this song , but ex-Clash band-mate ( and frequent Albarn-collaborator ) Paul Simonon \'s strings sound pretty good on the title track . The track is funky , a little bit eerie , and definitely keeps the mood of the album and its maybe-fictional-maybe-real setting at the center of your mind as your trek through Plastic Beach nears its end . 14 ) To Binge -- 5/5 For those not expecting Blur to ever make a guest appearance on this album -- well , do n\'t worry , they did n\'t . But this is as close as you \'ll ever get , since even the most casual Gorillaz fan will notice that 2D does n\'t sound anything like himself on this record . In fact , he sounds just like Albarn from Blur during the height of the 90s Britpop era . This time , however , he is trading verses with guest singer Yukumi Nagano who appears in her second contribution to the album . The song is like a fading sunset , with clouds developing as the song itself fades out . If this is the final album from the Gorillaz , I think this song serves as its official good-bye . And even though two more tracks come after this one , they feel more like encores than anything . 15 ) On The Cloud of Unknowing -- 4/5 But what encores they are ! Powerful , powerful stuff from Bobby Womack here , coupled with chilling and atmospheric instrumentation from Sinfonia ViVA , make this a contemplative song , even if the first few listens give little clue as to what you and singer are contemplating . It can be simply described as a pretty song . 16 ) Pirate Jet -- 4/5 I have an image of an animated pogo-stick or slinky , or something bouncy like that just hopping all over this song like a little kid . `` It \'s all good news now , because we left the taps running for a hundred years . \'\' Call it tongue-wagging sarcastic optimism at the prospect that even as foolish and wasteful we humans are , Nature will adapt to whatever is thrown at it , and persevere . That \'s my take , at least . And with that , the final opus in the Gorillaz trilogy ( this is widely rumored to be the final album for the group ) comes to a close . If you have made it to the end of this review , thank you . I had fun sharing my rambling thoughts on what I feel is a great album . If you have not already purchased this album , give it a try , you will be happy you did . ',normal

616,50_4_RI6LD0C4PET3V.txt,' It seems the main reason Dr. Peter Lillback calls George Washington a Christian , and not a Deist is because he believed in Divine Providence , or the belief that God is active in peoples lives . When we think of Divine Providence we think of the word Theism , and all the Abrahamic faiths that claim God personally spoke to key individuals called Prophets in the form of personal revelations . Understandably as words do change ( proving that the written word is not a good vehicle for the `` word of God \'\' ) from their original meaning , Mr.Lillback confuses the word Deist with the word Atheist ( non-Theist ) which really is the opposite of Theist . In todays world the word Atheist for the most part implies that there is no God . The word Atheist has changed from its original meaning , but we know that whenever you add an `` a \'\' in front of a word it means the opposite , so its the Atheist that believes in a inactive God , and not a Deist . The word Deist is derived from the word Deism that is derived from the word Deity which is simply the Latin word for God . A Deist is just someone who believes that God is , and the word Deism just implies a path of understanding . George Washington IMO was a Deist who was a Theist who followed the path called Deism . He believed in God , he thought that God was active in his life , and he knew to look towards the Creation ( the product that comes from God ) to gain true insight . Since Mr. Lillback uses Thomas Paine for an example of a Deist we should at least take Thomas Paine \'s definition on who , or what a Deist is , and what a true Deist believe . `` Every person , of whatever religious denomination he may be , is a DEIST in the first article of his Creed . Deism , from the Latin word Deus , God , is the belief of a God , and this belief is the first article of every man \'s creed . It is on this article , universally consented to by all mankind , that the Deist builds his church , and here he rests . Whenever we step aside from this article , by mixing it with articles of human invention , we wander into a labyrinth of uncertainty and fable , and become exposed to every kind of imposition by pretenders to revelation \'\' Thomas Paine thought that anyone who believes in God was a Deist ( including all Christians ) in the first article of his creed , which is the belief in a God . Mr. Lillback states in his book that Thomas Paine was a `` hard Deist \'\' . `` Hard Deist \'\' , apparently a new title that Mr. Lillback says he made up to describe a Deist that does n\'t believe in Divine Providence , or again the belief in the God that went away , and no longer intervenes in mans affairs . Again a `` Hard Deist \'\' if we must use the phrase describes what an Atheist would think , and not what a pure Deist would think . Dr. Peter Lillback either never read Thomas Paines works , or he \'s out right lying about Thomas Paines character in matters of God . All self professed Deists in our founding fathers day believed in Divine Providence even Thomas Paine . So `` Hard Deist \'\' , or even Atheist would not apply to Mr. Paine because Thomas Paine was a Deist ( he believed in God ) who was a Theist ( he believed that God was active in his life ) who followed the path called Deism . In Mr. Lillbacks book he quotes Thomas Paine several times , but he takes his words out of context to make his point clear about who , or what a Deist is , and what a true , or pure Deist really believes about our Maker . Before I quote some key phrases from Thomas Paine that clearly prove that he , like George Washington believed in `` Divine Providence \'\' I ask the reader to examine `` A Discourse At The Society Of Theophilanthropists \'\' This was a Theistic church that Thomas Paine was a key founder . Proving that Mr. Paine believed in an active God right up till the end of his life . Thomas Paine called God `` the Almighty lecturer \'\' . God had something to say to Thomas Paine , and luckily for us he wrote most of it down in all his Theological writings . `` The Almighty Lecturer , by displaying the principles of science in the structure of the universe , has invited man to study and imitation . It is as if He said to the inhabitants of this globe , that we call ours , \' I have made an earth for man to dwell upon , and I have rendered the starry heavens visible , to teach him science and the arts . He can now provide for his own comfort , and learn from my munificence to all , to be kind to each other . \' `` `` The world has been amused with the term revealed religion , and the generality of priests apply this term to the books called the Old and New Testament . The Mahometans apply the same term to the Koran . There is no man that believes in revealed religion stronger than I do ; but it is not the reveries of the Old and New Testament , nor the Koran , that I dignify with that sacred title . That which is revelation to me , exists in something which no human mind can invent , no human hand can counterfeit or alter . The Word of God is the Creation we behold ; and this Word of God revealeth to man all that is necessary for man to know of his Creator . \'\' Mr. Lillback is using his own definition of what a Deist is to prove that George Washington was n\'t a Deist , and his definition is wrong . Instead of making up your own definition of these words ( Deist , or Deism ) to prove your point why not get the correct definition from those who actually claim to be true , or pure Deists ? Most ( not all ) of todays self professed Deists of today like days of old will tell you that they believe in a active God . Did George Washington believe that our Creator overshadowed a young virgin girl who was engaged to be married to save us from the sins of the world , and all the mythologies that would also need to be believed as fact to prove this absurdity ? George Washington was enlightened enough to know mythologies from reality . Lets not taint this great mans legacy by saying he believed the Bible as an absolute literal truth just because you do Mr. Lillback . This book IMO in no way proves George Washington was a true Christian . Like they did with the man called Jesus years after his death making him into something he was not Dr. Peter Lillback does this with our great American hero George Washington . Turning , or perverting true \'history \'\' into his story , and twisting reality in the process . People who look for truth will know the difference . Mr.Lillback , we \'re all Deists who believe that God is . Where we differ is our path of understanding . If you want to learn all about the faiths of our ancestors then the Bible , Koran , and the like are a great place to gain insight , however if you want to learn about God then you must look towards the Creation , or all the products that come from God . I think George Washington knew this truth as he was surrounded by other enlightened `` pure \'\' Deists . Mr. Washington knew that books prove that man is real , and the Creation proves that God is real . This book will look great next to the other fat book in the evangelical library .

I was reluctant to buy it , based on the less-than-stellar reviews on here , but after using it for a week , I have no complaints at all . Maybe that \'s due to the fact that I \'m upgrading from the ancient 550 , and not the 7X5 series . The other reviewers are right , the on/off switch can be awkward , and you need a fingernail to push it over to the left . But that is such a minor complaint , in my opinion . Also , some people say they like the smoother refresh that the 7X5 series has , and this is more jerky , as you move along your route . Well , you \'re not supposed to be watching it when you \'re driving anyway . Oh , and it only has 500 waypoints , compared to 1000 on other models . I \'ll be lucky if I use 100 . What makes this GPS so remarkable is the voice recognition ! I feel like I \'m using Star Trek technology . It rarely has any problem understanding what I tell it . Hands free GPS navigation ! I never have to pull over to type a new destination ( or try to do it while driving ) . I ca n\'t imagine any of the minor complaints offsetting the awesomeness of the voice recognition . Now that it \'s available , I would n\'t have a GPS unit without it . If your budget allows for a voice recognition GPS with 1000 waypoints , an improved on/off switch , and smoother screen refresh , then by all means get that one . But if you \'re looking to spend about $ 300 , and want voice recognition , do not hesitate to buy the 855 .

625,33_6_R2OVOVLV9J544P.txt,' Zzzzz ... yet another movie with terrific CGI , a garbled plot , no human emotional connection , and a mixed bag of awful to above average acting . I actually started to fall asleep at various points in this movie .... One \'s senses are not quite as assaulted as with `` Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen \'\' , but this movie falls into that same class of an action movie hyped mainly for its special effects and yet unable to hold our attention just on that basis . Yes , there was a time , back in the days of `` Jurassic Park \'\' , when merely seeing this awe-inspiring CGI onscreen was enough to keep a moviegoer awake , but no more . Nowadays , terrific CGI is so ubiquitous that it is easy to be blase about seeing it onscreen ; the CGI nowadays is just part of a movie \'s landscape , like the potted plants and furniture . Enough , my eyes and ears tell me , so what if the Kraken/Medusa/Giant Crab/Monster Du Jour is attacking - do I care enough about the characters and plot that it means anything ? Without that essential emotional connection to the story and characters , watching massive quantities of CGI is just as sleep inducing as watching potted plants grow .

Another said that his acting was so wooden that it belonged in the lumbar section of the Home Depot . Mads Mikkelsen was one of the few actors to squeeze a capable performance out of this movie , as Draco , the co-leader of Perseus \'s merry band of monster-chow . Kudos to him for managing to retain his dignity , much more than Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes were able to do in this movie . The presence of these two stars bring to mind the latter days of Sir Laurence Olivier , who was willing to appear in almost any bad movie as long as they paid his fee . I would love to know just what was going through Liam Neeson \'s mind as he was walking around in that silly mirror-polished suit of armor and scraggly beard . Come to think of it , he did once do both in `` Excaliber \'\' ... so maybe that \'s what he was thinking . Ralph Fiennes - has playing one of the most effective evil Nazis of all time onscreen ( `` Schindler \'s List \'\' ) made him a lock for all the blockbuster Evil Bad Guy roles in Hollywood ? Take the money and run , is what seems to be going on here . One interesting visual effect of this movie was that all of the males were tanned a dark shade of bronze , whereas the two main female characters were left strikingly pale , which made me think that in the time of the Ancient Greeks , men and women were of different races . Or , perhaps the women were just locked up indoors all the time . Both women were cute and did a decent job in their roles , but the shag rug carpet which Io wore in her last scenes made me want to burst out laughing . Poor Gemma Arterton . Yes , the costume designer for this movie was beyond horrible . I could go on and on about the horrible costuming . Even worse , the Continuity Director must have been on drugs during the entire shoot . Or maybe it was just really bad film editing , combined with a fractured screenplay . Did anybody else notice the beautiful shot of sunlight breaking through the clouds ....... during the total eclipse ? Right , it does get awfully dark during a total eclipse , and that entire Kraken vs. Argos scene ( with Alexa Davalos getting strung up as Kraken food ) should have been in the dark , or twilight . But then , almost nothing made sense in this movie . The initial entry into the palace of the King of Argos - was it a festival or something ? What was with all the music and dancing girls ? Perseus and his group journey into Hades - Charon is mentioned , but barely seen - not enough left in the budget for a better Charon ? Then , having crossed the River Styx , they are not in Hades , but in Medusa \'s lair . WTF ? And when Perseus comes out , he is seen exiting a cave . What happened to recrossing the River Styx ? More questions - Why is Pegasus black ? What happened to Calibos \'s hand ? ( an interesting teaser , watching his hand come back to life ... and then nothing ) . Why is it mentioned that Medusa can only turn men to stone , not women , and then the Kraken gets turned to stone when it sees the Medusa head ? Does the Medusa head turn fish and crustaceans to stone also ? How about insects ? And oh dear me , WHY IS MEDUSA WEARING A BLACK BRA ? Imagine putting a bra on your pet snake , yes that \'s what that looked like . And of course , one can not go through the list of what \'s totally bad in this movie without mentioning the obligatory Hollywood caricature of the Extremist Religionist , who is stuck into this movie like a sore thumb . He appears as this skinny bare chested guy with mascara eyeliner shrieking in a British accent about offering up Andromeda as a sacrifice . In between trying to stay awake , I could only groan and sigh `` Not again \'\' at the grating appearance of this character .... There were lots of things like that which made me want to close my eyes during this movie ... ',ironisch

1119,19_6_R3292S64ZO6UP2.txt,' Hello , I live in the shadow of the largest casino in the Western hemisphere . As a compulsive gambler and liar , this is both a boon and a burden ; I only make enough money gambling to continue gambling , because I was fired from my job for gambling . My dream was to work at the casino , where I could get more money to spend at the casino . However , all of the people who work at the casino are Native Americans and they were probably racist ( at my white ) . I applied for a job more times than I can count on my nine fingers , but they always threw me out of the interview , usually before I could even vomit . But one day , I was browsing amazon.com and I stumbled upon The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee ( tm ) while I was looking for Mountain Dew and wolves , and I knew that things were about to change for me . I sold my year \'s supply of food stamps to a wino for about 30 bucks , and immediately signed up for an account and sent the shirt to my mom \'s house . Tense . Joy . Nervous . Happy . These words and more are words that I thought or felt as I ripped into the box with my claws that I made from biting my nails into points , being careful not to damage the 100 \% cotton fibers . I put on the shirt right away , hopped the bus to the casino and requested a job interview . The managers were already very familiar with me , but when they stood up to physically eject me from the room , they noticed my The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee . They were transfixed for over seven-and-a-half minutes . One of their noses started to bleed . The shirt spoke to them , as it had spoken to me . They knew that there was something special about this shirt , and about this man wearing it before them . They knelt on the ground , waved some herbs around , and turned down the AC to make a makeshift sweat lodge -- this was the real deal . I could tell , because I think they did something like that on Dances with Wolves or something ( wolves , again ) . Before long , I was accepted into the tribe as one of the members . They offered me a beautiful native virgin , and I have been talking to her on Facebook to see if she is the type of girl I might want to see a movie with ( probably not , unless she gets a tattoo on her lower back or ankle ) . I also got a dog . ',ironisch

631,50_16_R2Z2TQ5MHOVD3C.txt,' After having devoured The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ( Vintage ) I was very much looking forward to The Girl Who Played With Fire . But somehow the story did not captivate me as much as the first Lisbeth Salander / Mikael Blomkvist book . And here are my main points of criticism : 1 . There is no direct interaction between Lisbeth and Mikael in this story . They are connected by the events , yes , but the unique relationship that had begun to develop between them in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was not continued here , and for me this was a key element and one of the main reasons I was so fascinated with the characters . With every page I turned ( and there are many ! ) , I was hoping to see them come together again , alas it only happened at the very end of the book and even then there was no communication between the two . 2 . The storyline - to me - was much less believable than in the first book . There are a few ( for lack of a better word ) improbabilities here that almost ruined it for me . Especially the scene towards the end , where Lisbeth is confronted with her brother and her father and their unspeakable act against her ( I do n\'t want to give anything away , so no details but you will know what I mean when you get to it ) . The coherence I so admired in the first book was just not that well executed in The Girl Who Played with Fire ( Vintage ) . 3 . The end came extremely abruptly . I actually went online after finishing it to make sure that I had n\'t somehow received an issue with some of the pages missing . I just could n\'t believe that this book with several hundred pages and tons of details given on those would simply end like this . But it did and left me shaking my head a bit . In summary , this is not a bad thriller but it did not reach the masterful craftsmanship and effortlessness that made the first book an absolute standout in the ocean of thrillers on the market .

635,7_5_R2D7WSEYZTI5NH.txt,' There are some things to consider before buying this particular card or any other 32gb SDHC card on the market : 1 . This is NOT an ideal card for a digital SLR like a D80 , D90 , Rebel XT , etc ... That is because it is a class 4 device . The class of a SDHC cards has to do with how fast they read and write files , not how much storage they have . For a digital SLR , you should purchase a class 6 SDHC card most of the time . Class 6 cards will allow you to take \'bursts \' of photos and not be limited by the card \'s capacity to write them . Also class 4 cards are slower reading data , meaning they will take longer to upload files to your computer . Upload speed is convenient , especially when loading large batches of files . 2 . This card has far more storage than most people will need for their digital camera . Unless you like to keep all your photos on a SDHC card and never move them to your computer , or are a high volume photographer , there is very little need for more than about 8gb of storage space for most caeras . The possible exception to this is if you have a professional SLR that shoots files in the 16-20mb range -- but if you do , you \'ll likely want a class 6 card anyway . If all you intend to use this card for is a digital camera , save yourself a lot of money and buy a PNY 8GB SDHC Card . If you \'re worried about running out of space on a vacation , buy a few of them . Otherwise you run the risk of having \'all your eggs in one basket . \' If one card fails , you lose all your pictures instead of only a portion of them . This card is fantastic for use in a video camcorder capable of writing to an SDHC card . ( Check with the manual first to insure that a class 4 card will be fast enough first ) . It is also perfect as extra storage for an ultra portable computer or net book like the Asus EEE pc . Another great application would be as added storage to a personal media player or MP3 player equipped with a SDHC slot such as the Cowon D2 . There are other good 32gb SDHC cards on the market , some at cheaper price points than the Kingston card . IMHO , brand matters very little with something like a SDHC card , since they all are made pretty much the same way . None of the brands currently offering them ( Transcend , PNY , Kingston ) have high fail rates with their other products , so I believe they are all pretty similar . What you decide to buy will depend on whether you trust a particular brand , or who has the lowest price . All of them will work equally well . ',normal

1196,48_6_R1U7J1AHX5G1Z0.txt,' The quick version of this book : If you \'re pretty and pouty , you too can land yourself a gorgeous vampire boyfriend who will continuously save your a * * . Let \'s take our main character first - Bella Swann . Yet another heroine who does n\'t know she \'s beautiful and describes herself as shy but never exhibits the trait . The book is told in first person , which is unfortunate , because that means the reader is at ground zero for all of her insipid thoughts . She moves in with her father in his small town and holds contempt for just about everyone she meets at school , even though all they are doing is being friendly and including her . Not that any of this matters to Bella once she spots beautiful Edward . The next 500 pages are filled with purple descriptions of his magnificence , of how she \'s not worthy , of how could this god-like/Adonis-like creature stoop to love her . I \'m going to try to condense my irritation with Bella into a series of points : * She \'s ridiculously clumsy , which is meant to be a fault , is passed off as charming , but basically just gives her an asinine reason not to run so Edward can save her . * She `` falls in love \'\' with Edward within weeks of knowing him , and after a couple hundred pages , if he even mentions leaving , she hyperventilates and acts like her world will freaking collapse . Stalking is illegal in all 50 states , Bella . * Whenever Eddikens so much as barely brushes his lips with hers , she either tries to rip his clothes off ( natural ) or her heart stops beating and she passes out . The girl hit the floor so many times in this book she put Giles to shame . Which brings me to Edward . Angsty telepathic vampire Edward . While we have very little clear idea what Bella looks like , we get to hear about Eddiken \'s gorgeous , transcendental face and body over and over and over again . He \'s impossibly frustrating because he \'s been crammed with so many character traits , depending entirely on what the author wants him to be like at the time . He calls himself a monster and thinks he should have died all those years ago , but then totally lords his awesomeness over the mundane humans . And he is awesome . Lest you forget it , he \'s even awesomer than the rest of his vampire family at everything . But the worst part about Edward is how he treats Bella . He is initially attracted to her because her smell is particularly attractive to him ( okay , I \'ll bite ) and because he ca n\'t read her thoughts . ( Trust me , Eddikens , I \'m lookin \' right at \'em , and there ai n\'t nothin \' up there worth wondering about . ) He knows he \'s a danger to her ( woe ! ) and tells her straight off that it \'s better if they not be around each other ( sorrow ! ) ... and then he proceeds to hang all over her ! He berates himself once every few pages for putting her in danger but never has the guts to fix the matter because he `` just ca n\'t stay away from her \'\' and `` [ she \'s his ] life now . \'\' * wretch * The author \'s writing style is unimpressive . Not bad , per se , but it was n\'t giving me anything new . It all felt rather generic . Her vampires were n\'t bad - the `` ultimate predators \'\' and all that - but they were slightly ruined by her reasoning of why vamps ca n\'t go out in the sun . It \'s not because they \'ll burn up and die - it \'s because they glitter . That \'s right - these are GlamRock ! Vampires . I also can see how Bella never takes Edward seriously when he tells her he \'s dangerous and she should n\'t want to be cursed with vampirism . Honestly , the author never shows us anything negative about the condition . It \'s all quick reflexes , superiority and baseball games with the fam . The plot is bogus . Four hundred pages of ill-conceived romance and then a quick 100 pages of worse-conceived conflict . The romance , to put it frankly , is a little disturbing in how it borders on the obsessive , especially on Bella \'s side because he \'s just so , so , so beautiful ! And that \'s what bothers me the most about this book and the message that it sends to all of its rabid readers : the importance of beauty . Not inner beauty , either . Edward and his wonderful vampire family ( all of whom are good because they do n\'t feed on humans ) are described over and over again in all of their wonderful physical qualities . They \'re cardboard characters for us to admire . Bella , of course , does n\'t think of herself as beautiful , but the fact that she has four other boys in addition to the vampire falling all over themselves to please her begs to differ . I was willing to forgive the beauty of the vampires as a trait they acquire when they \'re turned , but a few others turn up later that are described as `` nondescript \'\' and ordinary-looking . And of course , they turn out to be the bad guys . Really , Stephanie Meyer ? I \'m not buying it . Or your sequels for that matter . ',ironisch

For this reason , I admire people like Pres . Clinton and Gov . Palin greatly . Clinton \'s `` My Life \'\' is one of my all-time favorite autobiographies . As I read through this book , it became clear to me , much like Pres . Clinton , Mrs. Palin is far from a perfect human being and she has not been without fault . To her credit , she did not try to hide everything in the book . She admitted to many of the mistakes she made during the campaign and her life in general , and she tried to give a hindsight review of what went wrong and how she should/would have done differently , although I wish she had played less of the blame game in the book overall . As a political moderate , I ca n\'t say I always agree with Gov . Palin \'s opinions and stances on different issues , but I respect her because she formed them based on her own personal beliefs and experiences and did not blindedly follow `` party leaders \'\' . The book also was Gov . Palin \'s first fair chance to explain some of the controversies that plagued her VP campaign , including the Troopergate , the Couric interview , the pregnancies ( both herself and Bristol ) and many more stories we never heard . Whether or not you want to take her words with a grain of salt , it at least is her side of the story that the media never presented us . All in all , a very good read that took us from her childhood days in Alaska as a tomboy who loved sports and outdoors , to her struggles in early adulthood with her husband and children , and eventually to her glamorous appearance along side Sen. McCain on the campaign trails . Whether you agree with her politics , I think this book presents much we could learn from her life .

Each character has their own special ability , as well as their own strengths and weaknesses , which adds some flare to the gameplay . What is also new about this addition is that a multiplayer mode has been included for more than just one player . The premise is fairly simple that most of us are already aware of . It covers years 1-4 from J.K Rowling \'s popular book series based on a teenage wizard . The game moves smoothly over each storyline of the book and stays true to the source material : defeating Aragon from the Chamber of Secrets , all the way to casting the Patronus charm at Dementors in the Prisoner of Azkaban . Gameplay and controls are fairly simple as well and especially fun when you are casting spells with your Wii remote . Many of the challenges involve quick puzzle solving and exploring unknown territory , and can become quite difficult . The crisp graphics combined with the dynamic and elevating score used from the movies also provides us with a clear insight into Harry \'s wizarding LEGO world . `` Harry Potter : Years 1-4 \'\' is by the far the finest Harry Potter video game to hit the shelves , possibly the best LEGO game . It gives us a new gameplay experience that we have not yet experienced in a Harry Potter video game and yet still harnesses that ability to captivate us .

Usable space on the drive is 931.5GB - I have the drive partitioned , 600GB for Time Machine and 330GB for general usage . The drive is very smart , with a textured top and glossy sides and has rubber feet . Both connectors ( power and usb ) are at the back , next to a white activity light , so there \'s nothing flashing at the front . The power lead is fairly compact ( compared to my Lacie FA Porsche drive ) , with the transformer built in to the plug rather than halfway along the lead . Even the USB cable is well designed , with moulded easy-grip ends . The drive is almost completely silent and runs very cool despite having no fan .

1130,18_2_R1ENBGAF006HGL.txt,' CASIO watches are the best thing that has ever invented . I bought this watch a little less than a month ago and was shocked and awed by the amount of attention I received over it . Before I bought the CASIO CA53W-1 Watch with Calculator I was a nothing , I was no one , no one on my campus recognized me . All of the people I knew were stupid gaming retards , all they cared about was Modern Warfare 2 coming out soon . They were like `` Sean come play Modern Warfare with us , it totally is the best game ever . Play Modern Warfare to tune your skills for Modern Warfare 2 . \'\' and I told them to get some lotion and go into the bathroom because I was n\'t playing any more video games , I was becoming a man . The first thing I did was to sell my xbox 360 and all its accessories on craigslist for $ 150 ( I had a lot of stuff ) , the reason being was that I had an epiphany when they told me to play Modern Warfare with them . The epiphany is : there will always be new video games coming out , most of them are n\'t worth your time . Anyways so I sold my xbox , and then I got a haircut . Well I got many hairs cut and ended up getting a fashionable haircut like that of Edward Cullen on Twilight . I figure all the girls love him right ? They all want to take him into the bathroom without lotion or Maxim , if I look like him , I will get all the babes . I also got a Bowflex PR3000 Home Gym , now I work out 3 times a week and I am totally ripped ( well at least I \'m ripping ) . I then purchased this CASIO CA53W-1 Watch with Calculator , the first girl that talked to me about it was Janet , from my circuit analysis class . She told me that she liked my watch , that maybe we should hang out sometime . Janet had always been my dream girl , smart , funny , engineering major , mildly overweight ( but in a good way ) , and she loved CASIO watches . I mean who does n\'t right ? Well I decided that the first girl that talked to me about my watch was going to be the one . I left circuit analysis class walking next to Janet , my ex-friend Jake from Modern Warfare came up to me and asked if I wanted to play in 20 minutes . I asked him what 7251 times 8 was , he could n\'t tell me . I flashed him my CASIO CA53W-1 Watch with Calculator and told him to go into the bathroom with some lotion and a copy of Maxim , he knew immediately that he would never talk to me again . I can not more highly recommend this watch to anyone , it is comfortable , has a watch , calculator , alarm clock , and most importantly for Janet and I it has a stopwatch . ',ironisch

650,32_20_R14HWBAKDUE0ID.txt,' I had my reservations going in to see this one , but it was surprisingly funny and did n\'t have to use much gross-out , potty humor or profanity that seems to be pervading many comedies these days in attempts to humor people . Instead , there was more slapstick style humor , and while it is the classic lovable loser meets girl scenario ( except at the mall ) and has its predictable moments , over all it was a pretty decent comedy . King of Queens star Kevin James plays Paul Blart , a long time mall security guard who is a bit lonely in life because of failed relationships . When he sees a beautiful woman working in the mall , he tries to figure out a way to connect with her , but his awkwardness gets in the way of his progress . Training a new mall security guard is n\'t what it seems to be , as this supposed high school dropout turns out to be the brains behind a massive robbery and hostage situation . It is up to Paul Blart , the only one who takes his job too seriously , to try and save the day . The first part of the movie was funny , but some of the gags were awkward at times ( trying too hard to be funny ) . What James brought to the character Blart was kind of a Chris Farley/John Candy kind of persona . I thought that the later half of the film was better , even though as usual you have to throw reason out the window . Not too bad of a film , and dare I say , it might even be one you could take a date to see . ',normal

1122,41_10_R3DP0OJY0MPDNM.txt,' It has been many moons since we laughed so hard and had so much fun watching an animated film . The Fantastic Mr. Fox , which of course I read long ago , is a most stunning and hilarious treat that I know we will watch again and again . The reviews here are splendid , so I will hone in on some points : 1 . Desplat has done it again with a soundtrack that kicks just right ... yet he does n\'t interfere with the terrific songs such as selections from Brian Wilson \'s `` Heroes and Villains \'\' . 2 . The vocal talent here is unmatched in animated experience . George Clooney pitted against Sir Michael Gambon ? Bill Murray sparring with Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson ( who voiced as well as directed ) ... superb ! Even the inimitable Brian Cox makes an absolutely side-splitting cameo . 3 . I have n\'t seen gripping stop-motion animation like this since the last time I saw a Russian animated film ... and that was LOOOOONG ago . This is such a must-see for all children . 4 . Saying which , I think the substitution of the word `` cuss \'\' where all cuss words would normally be used is one of the most brilliant things I \'ve ever heard . 5 . In case anyone misses the point , Roald Dahl , who was decades ahead of his time , meant this story to be a basic morality play about mankind \'s greed and seeming hatred toward animals . Yet the film also shows in the most humorous way the nature of wild animals as well . Who do you think is and ought to be the victor in this ? 6 . Keep eyes and ears peeled for various homages and references that the kids might miss . Marvelous , and I only wish I had more stars to award it ! OSCAR time for Best Animated Film feature-length !

First of all , the Altimeter , Barometer , and Compass are amongst the favorite of my features . The Barometer can be extremely accurate , along with the compass . Sometimes the Altimeter can be off measurement , but you can adjust that . I \'ve been wearing this watch for several days now and I plan to never take it off . It just has features that blow every other watch I have in my collection away . I always use the stopwatch and countdown timers on any digital that I have and this one adds ABC features on top of those as well ; world time , atomic time keeping , and solar power , and 100 meter water resistance are all just pluses in an already feature laden time piece . Not to mention the sunrise and sunset time \'s feature , which is really useful for maximizing the use of one day . All in All , I give this watch five stars from a dramatic improvement on Casio \'s part from the PAW-1300 . Update 6/22/10 * . * . * . * : As per other reviews , after owning the watch for a couple of months , I agree that the rubber strap is very uncomfortable .

I myself have changed the strap to an old 21mm nylon strap laying around in my drawer and the watch is way more comfortable .

And no wonder , as there never was any `` liquid contact . \'\' So either the ( non-existent ) liquid contact was at an acceptable level -- or the `` liquid contact indicator \'\' would have detected it -- or the indicator is faulty which would mean the product is faulty to begin with and it is no surprise then that the battery is faulty also , because Apple admits that even the fault indicator does n\'t work !

660,15_7_R1BY0Z0ZXNOTZ4.txt,' ` Blonde jokes \' , Bella talking non-stop about her incredible beauty , endless petty fighting between characters , rampant antifeminism , a disturbing anti-human sentiment , paedophilia . Stephenie Bella Meyer Swan is back and as self-absorbed and nasty as ever . Adjectives and adverbs are used to a laughable point . And the repetition is painful . Everyone \'s got ` tight eyes \' , and Alice is always ` dancing \' everywhere . Meyer trots out another string of beautiful blondes to show us how undesirable they are to her heroes . Can anybody say ` wish fulfilment \' ? ! The Mormon overtones are so obvious it \'s frightening nobody much thinks about it . The Mormon-style baby naming of combining family names . Meyer attended Brigham Young University - a Mormon university - where they are constantly told to marry young and start reproducing ; which is exactly what Bella Sue does . There \'s a frightening anti-abortion message : even if your spawn rips your body to shreds - kills you - you MUST fight everybody to keep it . Imprinting is essentially what Mormon ` sealing \' is . And , no doubt , Meyer pays tithings , which would mean every year the fans are sending millions of dollars to the Mormon church . How is it Americans were up in arms about a bit of magic in British Harry Potter books , but they \'re happy with paedophilia and religious propaganda in American Twilight books ? We \'ve got more ` werewolves \' ( sorry - at the very end of the book they are suddenly ` shapeshifters \' ) falling in love with babies . But do n\'t worry , one special baby is going to be ready for sexual duties by her seventh birthday . How romantic . The unintentionally hilarious scenes of the happy family - accompanied by paedophile Jacob - dressed to the nines , running off into the forest to guzzle on wild animals , tip this already ridiculous book even further over the edge . The appeal of the initial story was the contrast between Bella \'s humanity and Edward \'s immortality . The moment Bella wakes up a wild huntress superhero in possession of a ` love shield \' we lose any possible connection we could have had with her , as she divides her time between admiring her own beauty and fantasising sexually about her husband ( even when covered in blood , in a ripped cocktail dress , barefoot and in the middle of a forest ) . And how about those deux ex machinas ? ! Is n\'t it great how every time there \'s a problem something miraculous pops up out of the blue to save the day ? So once again none of our characters have to actually solve a problem , or - you know - do something . Additionally , I have no idea how any intelligent or sane person can remain a Twilight fan after reading about Edward EATING mutant vampire baby spawn out of his wife . Romantic it is not .

663,45_7_R3DG16ZIUFBHM.txt,' I was looking for another edition of TESS and could n\'t believe my eyes when I saw the `` average customer rating \'\' was only three stars . So I \'m taking a moment to correct the balance . TESS OF THE D\'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English . It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero . It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology . It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth , as much with sex as with dirt , blood , milk , dung , animal and vegetative energies . It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does . It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes . The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident , every paragraph , reverberates throughout the whole structure . Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work . Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published , at first . Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women , or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents . The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of `` Wessex \'\' make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel , though the works do n\'t otherwise bear comparison . Melville \'s great white whale is a far punier creation . Hardy \'s style is like no one else \'s . It is not snappy , as Dickens can be . It is not fluid and elegant , like George Eliot \'s . It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either . It has no journalistic flavor , but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense , echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as `` modern . \'\' Do n\'t start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD , another very beautiful book , where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest . Once you have the key to his style , then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes , e.g . Penguin , so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions . Hardy \'s lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere . The effect is not pretentious but timeless . There is wisdom , poetry and majesty here . Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience . I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels , why we care about them , or what they are capable of , without reading this one . ',normal

Relatedly , the Impact adds very little size to the phone and weighs next to nothing . The included screen protector works great too - I \'d heard of rainbow refractions and a slightly-milky appearance , but cleaning the surface well beforehand and working carefully resulted in a crystal-clear application . Ca n\'t tell it \'s even in place . No complaints on that front . I could do without the circular port on the back of the case , but it does nothing to harm structural integrity and it displays my MS sticker effectively . ; ) It will certainly do the same for the Apple logo , however ! The thickness of the silicone protects it from most direct scratchin \' contact . My second option in terms of cases was the Otterbox Defender , but I felt the Impact would suffice for day-to-day protection , and thus far this has certainly proven to be true . ',normal

However , a few days later , she suffered a brain hemmorage and was rushed to hospital . For many days she lay in a coma and I feared the worst . And then , late one night , I began playing this album to her and the moment she heard Katie Price \'s amazing voice her eyes began to flutter . By the end of track 3 she was sitting upright in bed , tossing her hair - and by track 5 we were making love like wild stallions . Needless to say , for both of us , this timeless and extraordinary album is little short of a miracle ! PS : Since writing this review , I have learned that my fiancee DID listen to the album many weeks before and this may , in fact , have caused her brain to nearly explode . However , this has done nothing to reduce my admiration for Ms Price and I look forward to her next album - \'Songs for Cross Dressing Cage Fighters \' - with great relish ! ',ironisch
1209,276426_6_R3L94NR8SKVK44.txt,' Avatar is a watershed moment in cinematographic history . It is a step forward as important as the first Star Wars movie was . Avatar is an experience not to be missed by any fan of movies , it is a truly impressive achievement . I \'ve been a movie fan since the late 1940 \'s , in all that time I had never gone to any movie more than once while it was in it \'s first run ... until Avatar . My wife and I have been to see Avatar three times in theaters ( once in each of the three formats : Big screen 3D ; IMAX 3D , and big screen 2D . We were favorably impressed by the movie , and the technology , in all three formats . We both felt that Avatar will be remembered as a powerful , ground breaking film , and that it will become a major classic . We recently bought the DVD and Blu-Ray two disc combination package ( from Amazon.com ) and consider the package to be one of the best bargains in entertainment . Getting two and a half hours of entertainment , in two high quality formats , each for the average price of one movie theater ticket is extraordinary ... especially when the film is just concluding it \'s first run in theaters . If you can see Avatar on a big screen ( in 3D or 2D ) by all means do so . I also recommend buying a copy to view at home ... the quality and the experience on a good digital TV screen are extraordinary .

680,33_11_R432NZW097LLE.txt,' First off , I researched for days before buying this Shark Mop . Many of the reviews slammed it due to lack of pivoting head , small tank and flimsy handle . Well , the NEW model has NONE of these issues ! The head pivots , the water tank is much larger ( I cleaned my medium sized kitchen and entryway floor and still have almost a full thing of water ) and it feels pretty sturdy - not flimsy . The handle is also adjustable in height to make it easier . Now to how it performed . Let me start by saying house cleaning week saw me with 2 or more different mops ! I have laminated wood flooring , hardwood flooring and kitchen tile . The Swiffer Wet Jet I bought left streaks on my laminate , was afraid to use it on the hardwood and since my kitchen tile is bumpy and uneven it left puddles and some areas would not even get touched by Wet Jet pad . So , I would clean my laminate with windex on my knees , my hardwood with hardwood cleaner and mop and my kitchen with a rope mop w/ammonia and water ( ONLY thing that would pick up the grime this horrible floor attracts ) . Having been diagnosed with a spinal disease , I would be hurting and exhausted from the bending , lifting bucket of water and mopping action . I finally got fed up and went to Bed , Bath and Beyond to try the Shark Mop - bad reviews and all . I have NEVER mopped so many floors so fast , had them ALL looking great AND not be hurting or exhausted . I can actually say mopping if FUN with this ! Now remodeling the second bathroom , it will have a different type of laminate - i \'m so glad I will NOT have to have a 4th mop or system to clean it too . The grime on the horrible , bumpy white tile in the kitchen ? It is so clean and streak free I \'m keep looking at it with the thought of `` wow \'\' going through my head . It NEVER looked this good and ALWAYS had streaks unless I squirted some Jet Dry in the mop water . In addition , after cleaning the kitchen floor , while preparing dinner , I had dropped the spatula with butter and egg on the floor . Then the youngest child decided to walk through the garage with bare wet feet and then onto my clean white tile floor . 30 seconds of heat up and less than 60 seconds later , floor was clean again . SO EASY . I will NEVER go back to regular mopping ever again . I ca n\'t wait to try it in the travel trailer ( I do that linoleum on my hands and knees after trips ) . You wo n\'t be disappointed in the new one - spend the extra $ $ $ to get larger tank , pivoting head , extra mop head attachments and steam duster ! ',normal
681,34_11_R33545PT2IGAL5.txt,' Remedy Entertainment announced Alan Wake all the way back in 2005 during the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo . Since then it \'s popped on and off of people \'s radars at sparing intervals , and now that it \'s finally been released , it seems as if Duke Nukem Forever should be only just around the corner . It can then only be described as fortunate that with such a long development period , Alan Wake has turned out to be a compelling and rewarding title to experience . The game \'s protagonist holds the title \'s namesake , and is presented as a highly-successful suspense-thriller novelist who -- with due thanks to an extended case of writer \'s block -- has n\'t managed to put words to paper in the two years since his last release . He and his wife Alice take off to the quaint town of Bright Falls , nestled within the mountains , in an effort to get away from the fast-paced New York lifestyle , and to give Alan a change of scenery and a chance to get over his ailment . After a brief argument between the two , Wake \'s wife disappears , and the writer begins finding pages to a manuscript for a novel he has n\'t written yet . What \'s worse is that the horrors scribed into the document begin occurring in earnest , and all of this sets off a mystery that \'s much bigger than Alan Wake himself . The driving force here is undoubtedly the unyielding fiction backing the whole of the package . There \'s nothing particularly profound about the narrative , but the means through which it \'s delivered is striking . The main bits of Alan Wake \'s story occur through traditional cutscenes , but you as the player will come across transcript pages , radios , and televisions , all of which will give tremendous insight into the past , present , and even future events surrounding your actions . It \'s not impossible to grasp the entirety of the plot \'s intricacies without these easter eggs of information , but there \'s no doubt that they assist incalculably with coloring in the dark and dreary world that would otherwise only be outlined . There are some very story-centric portions of the game that take place during the daylight hours , but you \'ll spend the bulk of your time transversing Bright Falls and its outlying woodlands by night . That \'s when all the spooky stuff happens . There are these dark-enshrouded creatures called the Taken , and there is n\'t a single one of them that would pass up an opportunity at putting an axe in Wake \'s spinal column . Fortunately they do have a weakness , that being anything fluorescent in nature , and resultingly you \'ll spend a lot of time fumbling around with a flashlight . There \'s nothing overly complex about the gunplay ; burn away the darkness surrounding the Taken , and pop them a couple of times with a weapon of choice . There are bigger , badder enemies , but the only variation they apply is the longevity of your aforementioned actions . It \'s the simplicity and redundancy of the combat that serve as Alan Wake \'s only real drawback . Nothing about how you dispose of your night-stalkers ever really changes through the game \'s ten hour run . There \'s some stronger enemies , some faster ones , and even some malevolent demon crows to dispatch of . There are some possessed objects that \'ll fly at you , and a few pieces of heavy farm equipment that make it their sole duty to run you down , but the process undergone to remove the threat is essentially the same regardless . This is n\'t to say that there \'s no fun to be had with the shooting ; you \'ve got plenty of ways to make things entertaining for yourself , from flare guns , to flashbang grenades , to hunting rifles . But if simply switching out your weapons every once in a while does n\'t help you in disguising the action , you \'re likely to find yourself a little burned out with the repetitive temperament of the rather frequent combat encounters . There \'s a thin layer of visual fidelity coating the town of Bright Falls , but all of that mostly emerges during the odd daylight segment . Everything looks pretty good at best , passable at worst . There \'s some stiffness and irregularities to the character motions , especially when you tell Wake to climb just about anything . The characters usually are n\'t all that prone at keeping their lips synced with the excellent voice acting , which is distracting during cutscenes . Where the game is at its best is when it has free aim to showcase its lighting effects . I \'m still not sure if they \'re the best I \'ve seen in a game , or if it just seems that way given how much of a staunch presence they have in the world . Headlights , street lamps , and even the gentle blinking of a computer terminal all stand as beacons of attention as you wander through the roads and forests . You \'ll even find that bounding through certain of these restore Wake \'s health and trigger a checkpoint . These effects all invite a sense of hope and an even stronger sense of environment into a world where your primary enemy does its best to conceal both . It \'s the strong deliverance of the narrative and a clear sense of place that lend their hand to making Alan Wake the game that it is . The constant conflict with the Taken eventually leaves something to be desired , but that just makes it all the more baffling that the game can get away with being as compelling as it is . There \'s a good time to be had with Remedy \'s latest , and there \'s little to regret about spending the full duration and seeing it through to the end . Just be sure and pack an extra flashlight and revolver , because Wake always seems to be forgetting his . ',normal

This day and age , kids are programmed by our government to think that everyone is out to destroy us and that they need heroes to come and save us all . They forget that there are everyday people out there who need a little compassion and understandng . I make my kids sit down every day for at least an hour and play with the Cat Lady . We talk about what has made her the way she is and we discuss different options of things we might do to help her . We get into conversations about what rle society plays in the creating of these people who seriously have issues and then we practice empathy role play by having our social services action figures come to her aid and get her the help she needs . It has created hours of educational fun for our entire family . I recommend also purchasing the Albino Bowler and the Obsessive Compulsive action figures as well . We have used a cardboard box and built a small Mental health center/Halfway house where we keep our action figures always getting the help they need from the little doctors and nurses who work there .

Each time giving up due to the pinching , non close shave and pain in the butt cleaning . In the end , I was going back to razor blades and the frequent cuts . I went to Braun \'s website and read about this shaver and came to Amazon to see the reviews here . I decided after reading the reviews to splurge on another electric shaver . What a find ! This in my humble opinion is the greatest invention EVER ! It \'s the first electric razor I \'ve used which does n\'t get hot after a couple minutes of use.Hot razor means sweaty face which trips up razor and adds to pinching . Braun recommends you shave before you shower or wash your face , while you still have a little protective barrier of oil on your skin . A big no-no with regular shaving , this worked well with the Pulsonic . They also recommend you shave against the grain . Again , not recommended for regular shaving . For electric shaving , works great . I must say I Absolutely LOVE shaving now . ( I would let my beard grow for days because I HATED shaving with razors and cutting myself ) . The Pulsonic is the closest shave ever by an electric razor ( IMHO shaves as close as a razor once you master it ) and more importantly it does not pinch or burn at all . Even better is the self cleaning which make life easier . My wife laughs every morning as she now sees me shaving daily with this god send ! if you are reading bad reviews on this product it must be I just do n\'t get it . Bottom line : BUY THIS NOW ! I just ordered another one for my son ! I am telling all who read this if you hate shaving GET THIS PRODUCT you will love it . ',normal

688,3_17_R294QV27UQQ5Y8.txt,' I had been looking at the various netbooks for a while and really liked Toshiba \'s NB205 but just could n\'t get around the negative comments on battery placement and speaker quality . The NB305 was specifically designed to address these concerns - different battery placement and two speakers instead of just the one on the 205 . As for things this shares with the 205 : The chiklet keyboard just rocks - space between the keys goes a long way towards cutting down on the mistypes that you get on the keyboards where the keys are merging one into the next . It may not matter to many people but if you have a long haired cat or dog that sheds and likes to spend time in your lap the fact that this is a much easier keyboard to keep pet hair out of is a huge plus as well . Having two separate mouse buttons instead of one rocker bar is handy for those of us who like to actually use the right click . Keyboard layout as a whole is very `` touch type \'\' friendly so those who actually learned how to type on a real keyboard or -gasp- typewriter can actually use this keyboard . Portability is also another huge plus , when it \'s closed this little guy does n\'t have much more of a footprint than a decent sized hard cover book and while I realize that this just means it \'s a netbook as somebody who still remembers his high school computer lab having IBM PS-2 \'s it \'s still amazing . In an effort to make this a true review I \'ll also hit a few of the things that are shortcomings for the NB305 . Is this going to let you watch high def movies - no . Is this going to let you play World of Warcraft or other graphic intensive games - no . Are you going to be able to multi-task 5 different RAM intensive applications - be serious you only have 1G of RAM or 2G if you upgrade . The reason I \'m giving such a great rating to this netbook is that having said all of the things that the NB305 - and for that matter netbooks in general - ca n\'t do the simple fact is that I do n\'t want to do and would n\'t expect to do those things on a 10.1 in screen to begin with . If you want to play games there are laptops targeted for that market , if you want to watch HD video get a laptop with a blue-ray not something that does n\'t even have an optical media drive . You can get a laptop that plays games - full discloser I have one , handles HD video and/or serves as near `` desk top replacements \'\' and you can get them for not a lot more than you will spend to get the NB305 , what you will not get is the portability . Personally I want something to check my email , check headlines on the web , watch the occasional You-Tube , do word processing , handle I-Tunes and allow me to use a Citrix client to access the work related apps on a server when I \'m away from the office and still fit in my briefcase .

From a young child \'s love of earning Girl Scout merit badges , to a 14-year-old Goldwater Girl \'s trip to see Martin Luther King , to a modern senator \'s remarkably unique reason for voting for authorized force against Iraq ( she said it would make `` war less likely \'\' ) , there \'s never a dull moment . And thanks to interviews with more than 200 Clinton associates and more than 500 footnotes , every sentence rings true . The book does n\'t offer any juicy gossip , but does have lots of intimate behind-the-scenes detail . Hillary \'s first college boyfriend supplies Bernstein with the letters she wrote to him ( what a jerk ! ) , in which the 18-year-old freshman describes herself as `` a progressive , an ethical Christian and a political activist \'\' who is nevertheless `` outrageous ... as outrageous as a moral Methodist can get . \'\' Later on , Bernstein reveals that Bill Clinton asked Hillary to marry him many times before she finally said yes , and that once in Arkansas he told her he had fallen in love with another woman and wanted a divorce , which she refused . Toward the end of the book , the author recounts a moment during the peak of the Lewinsky crisis , when Stevie Wonder met Hillary at a White House dinner and insisted on taking her to a private room to perform a song he had written for her -- about forgiveness . What impressed me most about `` A Woman in Charge \'\' is how well it is written . Though every chapter is meticulously well documented , each explains its often-complex story in a clear and engaging style . You can picture yourself in the Yale dorm room when , in 1968 , the politically active junior hears of Martin Luther King \'s assassination and pounds the wall , screaming `` I ca n\'t stand it anymore ! I ca n\'t take it ! \'\' And you ca n\'t help but cringe when you read of Hillary \'s first meeting with Virginia Cassidy Blythe Clinton Dwire -- Bill \'s mom -- after the charismatic woman with the `` white-striped hair and fondness for fast men , fast horses , red lipstick and false eyelashes \'\' had driven up to New Haven from Arkansas in 1972 : `` Virginia thought Hillary was a fright , \'\' Bernstein writes , `` her hair badly cut ( she had chopped it herself that semester , to save money ) , no makeup , and jeans , her preferred posture tending toward a hippie slouch . \'\' Equally compelling are the White House chapters , as Bernstein explains how Hillary \'s own overzealous promotion of her 1993 health-care plan ironically caused it to fail , but how her similar devotion to defending Bill against impeachment charges caused that fight to succeed . `` A Woman in Charge \'\' includes eight pages of black-and-white photos , mostly from Clinton \'s years as First Lady . Under the book jacket is a plain gray cover . All in all , what emerges is a sympathetic portrait of an extremely bright and talented American woman who has overcome a lot to get where she is -- but can nevertheless be cold , calculating and , worst of all , sometimes completely clueless on how to get things done . Bernstein shows how Hillary has learned from many of her mistakes and excelled in the Senate , but in the process has formed such a `` protective shell \'\' around her true character that she may , or may not , have what it takes to win the nomination , get elected , and be a great President .

1095,25_2_R1YDDX28V2RGFS.txt,' Well , its finally happened after all these years ! The Wicked Witch of the West has finally met her match and her name is Rhoda Janzen whose cackling and theatrics throughout her narrative would make Dorothy jump right out of those ruby slippers . But if Oz is a little too old fashioned for your taste and you are into a more modern line of fiction then one only has to look at the recent book/movie Mean Girls to see the type of character traits that it appears that Janzen has . Truly , the only difference between this book and Mean Girls is that the characters are older and less well developed . Normally I do n\'t waste my time reading catty literature about people obviously suffering from what appears to be narcissistic personality disorder but I had heard that this book was humorous . While there are a few funny tales most of the time Jansen does not delve into her family \'s intentions and motivations . Instead , she just skewers them leaving the characters flat and two dimensional ... an easy way out often taken by novice and inexperienced writers . If Jansen learned about love as she claims then hers is definitely a twisted and warped idea of what constitutes true love and should probably be sharing a cell with the ghost of Squeaky Fromme . I do have a suggestion for Jansen \'s next attempt . It appears that Snarky B * * * * would be very fitting title . ',ironisch
700,21_1_R35YQIJK8JHCLA.txt,' I was skeptical about this album . I did not know what to think of it at first . The more I listened , the more it grew on me . This is an edgy collection of hard-hitting electro-pop songs , made all the more irresistible by their high-octance punk energy and her irrelevant lyrics and attitude . The songs showcase her flair of story-telling , her choice of subject matter is not exactly conventional . The album \'s title came from an diving experience she had and she was almost bitten by a barracuda . This album also has an empowering , carefree message for young women .

1091,39_19_R2XT7SQXSVMP2D.txt,' I \'ve only read a couple books by Jane Green and was not impressed but this book was unbelievably good ! Granted I am nearly 9 months pregnant and have a toddler of my own but this book had me bawling . I was so invested in the characters and what happened to each that I almost could n\'t finish the book out of fear of what would happen . Steff is your typical chick lit , flighty character and you can pretty much predict what would happen to her in the end . Still the story was written in such a way that it will keep you engaged and hoping for a happy ending for all of the main characters . Callie \'s husband at first had me guessing if he was going to go the route of the busy working husband who would turn out to be a cheater or a loving husband that would be there no matter what . The other nice thing about this book was each chapter opens up with a recipe . Some of them sounded so tasty I may just have to try them out myself . Really there was n\'t anything I actively disliked about this story . The only slightly negative thing I can say is much of the story is predictable but I find that true of all chick lit books . This is definitely a must read book but have a few tissues on hand . ',normal

706,21_12_R3Q5VKRJUVE8EB.txt,' Michelle Malkin is a lady who makes her money by throwing dirt at politicians she considers left-wing . That there is money to be made in this sort of endeavor , can be seen in the number of right-wing screeds multiplying on bookshelves everywhere these days . Malkin \'s latest , Culture of Corruption : Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats , Crooks , and Cronies , joins another work , Unhinged : Exposing Liberals Gone Wild . As you might guess , there \'s nothing surprising in her latest work , as anyone familiar with her blogs , and cable news appearances , probably already knows . The general tone of the books is Malkinian rage . Reading her latest , one is reminded of the sort of thing one hears at the various town-hall meetings as well as the tea-bag gatherings . All shouting and nonsensical accusations . But what of her accusations ? Has Mr Obama surrounded himself with tax cheats , crooks and cronies ? He has n\'t of course , but in Michelle Malkin \'s case the matter is somewhat more complicated . Her brain does n\'t operate in a manner that corresponds to the real world . This is somewhat peculiar since at one time she was a respected reporter for the Seattle Times . But that was then , and this is now . Her brain is operating on a different frequency these days . One that clearly ignores reality . Before getting into Malkin \'s main charges against the Obama administration , it \'s interesting to note that Michelle Malkin is not just interested in the tax cheat-crook-crony angle , she has other objections . For one thing , she says , Obama \'s administration is made up of over-educated achievatrons . Brainiacs . People who are too smart . People who are n\'t dumb . ( Worse yet , the children of members of the Obama administration send their kids of Georgetown Day School . Georgetown Day School ! Where they will someday grow up to be valedictorians like their parents and join still another leftist administration . ) This chills Malkin \'s blood . Oh , and do n\'t forget the fact that according to the author , the New York Times ( that fish-wrap of a newspaper ) owns Obama , or perhaps it \'s vice-versa . The author does n\'t really make it clear . The first chapter of the book smears Obama with all the charges listed above and more . The remainder of the chapters , deals with a multitude of so-called scandals and vetting errors , the Obama administration has engaged in . And it proceeds to name , somewhat exhaustively a list of individuals or institutions Michelle Malkin dislikes . I mean she really dislikes them . Let \'s look at just a few of Malkin \'s dislikes . Bill Richardson starts the list . Richardson was involved in an investigation dealing with transportation contracts when he was Governor of New Mexico . Nothing was ever proved and ultimately the charges against him were dropped . But that \'s enough for Malkin to brand him a crook . He never did anything wrong , but he \'s a crook nevertheless . Next , let \'s look at Attorney General Eric Holder . Mr Holder is a crime-coddler . How do we know this ? Well , Eric Holder actually gave some advice to President Clinton recommending clemency in the case of some terrorists and as well as Marc Rich . Note that Holder had no independent power to grant clemency , only the president can do that . Still Eric Holder is a , well , he \'s not a tax cheat , he \'s not a crony , maybe he \'s a crook . Malkin does n\'t make that clear either . Again , the fact that Eric Holder has never ever been accused of a crime or found guilty of a crime does n\'t matter in Michelle Malkin \'s world . Malkin \'s list of phony charges goes on and on . Even Mrs Obama is not spared . Her offense : Dressing in expensive clothing . Also , she comes out of Chicago politics and she \'s actually made money in the private and semi-public sector . Which according to Michelle Malkin makes her some kind of well , take your pick -- tax cheat , crook , crony ? I do n\'t know . There \'s no need to go down the list of individuals and institutions Michelle Malkin hates . But here are a few more . Acorn is a bunch of shake-down artists . The Services Employees International Union is a bunch of thugs . Obama and his administration engage in a complex web of incompetence , nepotism , influence peddling and self dealing . They do n\'t of course , but Michelle Malkin says they do and that \'s that . Malkin makes a big deal about `` tax cheats \'\' What \'s her definition of a tax cheat , you might ask ? Well , it \'s anyone what overlooks some element of the tax form and forgets to file some income or another . Does n\'t matter if it \'s an honest mistake , in Michelle Malkin \'s world there are no such things as honest mistakes . The members of the Obama administration are constitutionally unable to make mistakes . When they file an erroneous tax return ; they are TAX CHEATS . The author likes to spend a lot of time discussing the case of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . Geithner erred to the tune of thirty or fourty thousand dollars in a couple of his tax returns , over a period of several years . During this period he paid all his other taxes . But because he erred , ( no , according to Michelle Malkin he did n\'t err , he CHEATED ) he \'s therefor branded a monstrous tax cheat . And on and on its goes for about 290 pages or so . If you \'re looking for proof that Obama administration is a hotbed of tax cheats , crooks and thugs , you wo n\'t find it here , what you will find are a lot of absurd , baseless , partisan accusations , typical of what you can also find on Fox News and right-wing talk radio if you listen long enough . So , if you hate the current administration as much as Malkin does , you might like this book . Personally I disliked it . I found it boring , hate-filled , irrational and totally predictable . In other words , totally Malkinian . . ',ironisch
1227,276423_8_RMW5NHC2TTCE2.txt,' EDIT : An updated and revised review of this laptop can be found at over at Expert Laptop Review : [ ... ] I recently went on a laptop buying rampage and have ended up with the Dell Studio 14z , HP dm3z ( L625 + Radeon 4330 ) , and the Asus UL80VT-A1 in possession all at once . The first part of this review will focus solely on the Asus UL80VT-A1 and the second part of this review will compare it with my experience with the Dell Studio 14z and the HP dm3z . ASUS UL80VT-A1 DETAILED REVIEW First and foremost , let me say that I ordered the UL80VT-A1 because I thought it was simply an awesome idea to have switchable graphics in a laptop because you get excellent battery life + excellent performance when needed . There were no reviews of the UL80VT out when I purchased it , so I purchased the UL80VT-A1 from [ ... ] , which has a 100 percent refund on purchases just in case things did n\'t work out with me and the new lady . While I was waiting to recieve the laptop in the mail , I read a review over at [ ... ] . Oh boy , was I disappointed considering all the bad things the reviewer had to say about it ( i.e . bad keyboard , bad track pad , horrible build quality , poor gaming performance ) . Needless to say , I had second thoughts about even opening up the Asus UL80VT-A1 because I did n\'t think it was worth my time considering the all the problems the reviewer had with his review model . So that morning I got my HP dm3z in the mail and was really excited about how incredibly beautiful the laptop was . It is definitely sexier ( in my opinion ) than every other ultraportable out there , including the Macbook Pro 13 \'\' and HP Envy 13 . I \'ll get to the dm3z a little later ... either way , my first impression led me to believe that I \'d probably be keeping the dm3z and just returning the Asus . When the Asus came in the mail , I was n\'t even watching for it like I had been the dm3z . But I did take it upstairs and opened it up . ( Unboxing video coming soon ... ) FIRST IMPRESSIONS My first impression was astoundingly contradictory to review I had read . I picked it up , squeezed it , pushed on the keyboard , which had minimal flex that was n\'t noticeable to me when typing . My other first impressions were just how well the trackpad worked . The two finger scroll worked flawlessly ( though it is n\'t as smooth of a scroll as Apple \'s , it functions equally responsively and is just as useful ) . GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE - Rating 9/10 Over the last view days , I \'ve been taking the UL80VT-A1 out for spin in a series of gaming tests . The first game I tested was the ever popular Counter-Strike : Source . I was astounded by the computer \'s ability to put out 150 FPS in the stress test at native resolution of 1366x768 . I had been expecting to get closer to 80-100 FPS . I then tested it with 4x AA on , and it resulted in 99 FPS , which is phenomenal considering that AA usually cripple weaker graphics cards like the Nvidia 210M . I was eager to test out the UL80VT \'s performance in some of the latest games because of the previous review I had read that had denounced its ability to play modern games . I had recently purchased Batman : Arkham Asylum . I loaded it up with the default settings , which were set on Very High at native 1366x768 resolution . Game play was moderately smooth and playable , but it was also noticably choppy at times with those settings ( 26 FPS average in the video stress test ) , so I dropped the settings down to medium . This time the Asus got 40 FPS average in the video stress test , and the game play was perfectly playable and smooth . I then downloaded Team Fortress 2 . It has been known to give ultraportable gaming machines a tough time due to its high shader requirements . When playing , I averaged about 50-60 FPS at native resolution with everything on High with no AA . I noticed drops down to 30 FPS when in heavy action , but it was not too disruptive to game play . I do n\'t think it went below 30 FPS during the time I played . After hearing claims that Asus UL80VT could not run Need For Speed : Shift well . I downloaded the demo to see if these claims were true . Fortunately , they were not . I was able to achieve playable frame rates , though it was a little choopy with the default settings , which had the screen at 1024x768 resolution and everything else up in detail . I tried changing the settings , but after changing the settings to lower the resolution to 800x600 , the game repeatedly gave me an error and crashed right as the race was about to start . Unfortunately , I was not able to do a formal test , but it was clear that the game was getting at least 30 FPS at 800x600 resolution with texture settings on High . I would expect the game to be very playable as long as you are content with 800x600 ( or maybe slightly better res ) and medium settings . I also managed to squeeze in a little play time in Protoype , another recent game that was released earlier this year . It played very smoothly at the default 1280x720 ( which was the max res for some reason ) and on the default medium settings . Another game I was able to try was Call of Duty : World at War , which has identical specs to the latest Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 . People will be glad to know that I was able to achieve 35-40 FPS constant at native resolution 1366x768 with texture settings on `` normal \'\' ( except for `` shader settings \'\' which I set to `` low \'\' ) . I also turned off all of the extra graphical features , which did n\'t make much of a difference in visuals anyway . In conclusion regarding the gaming peformance of this ultraportable laptop , it has excellent performance and handles most modern games fluidly at native resolution . BATTERY LIFE - Rating 10/10 Yesterday , I used the laptop for 3 hours early in the morning with wifi on and brightness up . Later that day , I used it for about 15 minutes running Batman : AA . I then used it about 7 hours more with brightness at about 20 \% ( 2.5 hours with wifi on and 4.5 with it off ) . In total the laptop lasted me 10.25 hours between a mixture of wifi , gaming , and note taking/paper writing . I was extremely happy to get this excellent of performance out of it . This was precisely what I was looking for in terms of battery life . BUILD QUALITY - Rating 6/10 My initial impression was that the build quality was just average -- not great , but nothing bad about it either , but now after having it for a couple days , I now agree with Charles \' review about some of the issues with build quality . Yesterday morning when I was typing , I noticed that when I pressed down on the front edge of the left palm rest it squeaked annoyingly ( it had n\'t pressed down on this part of the laptop when it was on a hard surface yet because it had always been on my laptop up until this point ) . I began squeezing the front edge and noticed that top part of the chassis is n\'t cemented to the bottom part of the chassis very well so that when you put pressure on it ( such as when you rest your palm on it ) it made a noise . I tried placing about an inch long piece of scotch tape across the part that was sqeaking , and the squeaking went away completely . It was disappointing to find this because it was the first issue with the build quality . Also , I now understand what Charles meant when he said that when he pressed in the center of the laptop it causes the bottom of the laptop to touch the surface it is resting on ... It \'s not if you press in the middle of the keyboard like I had thought Charles had said ( my bad ! ! ) ... it \'s if you press on the trackpad buttons ( like Charles had really said ) , he was right that you can feel the laptop touch the surface it is resting on , but the thing Charles was wrong about is that it is n\'t the bottom of the laptop touching the surface below it ... it \'s a little `` support peg/foot \'\' that protrudes from the bottom of the laptop about 1/10 \'\' of an inch . The overall chassis does flex a tad , but it is just the peg touching , and the peg is maybe moving 1/16 \'\' of an inch tops ( probably less ) . So yes , the chassis does flex just a hair , but not as bad as the review makes it sound ( I think the review should be updated with this information personally ) . I am thinking about putting a drop of super glue on the edge of the left palm rest to keep it from squeaking . I \'m pretty sure it would work without a hitch unless you put too much glue and then tried to take the casing apart and was n\'t able to . I figure it would n\'t void the 1 year accidental warranty but maybe the 2 year standard warranty if they figured out what I did . I \'m not sure though ... I figure you can always `` cut through \'\' the glue so that the chassis can be opened if you needed to send it in for repairs . I also noticed that the entire surface ( including the aluminum top ) acquires fingerprints . I was disappointed that the aluminum top also was prone to oils from my fingers . HEAT MANAGEMENT - Rating 10/10 The heat on this bad-boy is hardly noticeable . I think more heat is generated because it is restricting the airflow over your lap more than anything . Whenever my lap started to feel a little warm , I would feel the bottom of the laptop but the bottom of the laptop never got hot . It was always just the fact that my legs were n\'t getting as much air to cool them down . I was also able to play Batman : AA while on my lap just fine , though it was starting to be mildly uncomfortable by the time 30 mins rolled around . Still , as far as gaming on the lap goes , I think it would be doable , and far more doable than on any other laptop I have ever tried . This laptop is by far the coolest running laptop I have ever owned ( I \'ve owned about 14 different laptops ... ) . For this reason , I give it a 10/10 in heat management . KEYBOARD - Rating 8/10 Overall , I find the keyboard to be a little above average . I do not like the fact that there are no keys dedicated to playing and pausing music . To access media controls , you must hold the FN button down and tap the arrow keys ( down arrow = play/pause ) . I do not notice any flex when typing . The primary concern that I had was from the squeaky palm rest edge when typing . After I fixed that issue , the keyboard became quite pleasant to use . TRACK PAD - Rating 9/10 I find the track pad to be the best track pad I have ever used on a PC . It does have a glossy surface , but I did not find that the surface was not nearly as sticky as the surface on many HPs ( including the dm3z ) . I also found the trackpad to be responsive and that the multitouch gestures such as two-finger scrolling to work perfectly nearly every time . The ELAN touch pad has configurable options to enable you to change the sensitivity of the two-finger scroll as well as enable you to use two and three finger taps to do customizable actions . I have my two-finger tap to do a right click and my three-finger tap to show my desktop . My only complaint regarding the touch pad is that the uni-button . The uni-button looks like only one button , but has a left side and right side that makes up two buttons . When the uni-button was pressed towards the middle , it was very difficult to click , but if you pressed it near the ends the button became more usable . This was also the case with the Acer Timeline 4810t that I had owned for some time . I have found that the tap to click function is very usable , especially since I can just use two fingers if I need to right click . Therefore , I hardly use the button anymore anyway . My system works just fine . OVERALL VERDICT - Rating 9/10 Despite its ( fixable ) flaws in build quality and poor touch pad button ( again just use `` tap to click \'\' instead ) , I \'m still impressed with laptop and can definitely recommend it to friends who are n\'t particularly picky about build quality . The UL80VT-A1 will provide the performance most casual gamers want in a portable package that has a very long battery life and is inexpensive compared to similar models . [ Oh , wait , scratch that ... There has never been anything like the UL80VT-A1 to ever come out before ... except maybe the Acer Timeline 3810TG that had switchable graphics , but that computer was only available in the UK . ] COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION ( DELL STUDIO 14Z and HP DM3Z ) I have now owned a Dell Studio 14z for about two months . I also purchased a HP dm3z , which I had originally planned on writing a review of but I do n\'t know if I \'ll find the time . Maybe I \'ll just do a video review ... Anyway , the HP dm3z initially impressed me tremendously with its fantastic metal looks and thin profile . However , two issues became immediately apparent that prevented me from considering the laptop further : the HP dm3z produced a tremendous amount of heat even while just idling ( the bottom got roasting hot while playing games ... though the palm rests stayed pretty cool ) and I quickly became frustrated by track pad lag and malfunctioning two-finger scrolling . The problem with the two finger scroll is due to the fact that it does not always register that you are actually using two fingers , therefore , it thinks you only have one finger down and shoots your mouse all the way across the screen where you did n\'t want it to go . Beside the two-finger scroll I noticed minimal track pad lag ( though there was lag ) . The track pad was definitely usable and should not prevent someone entirely from purchasing it for that sole reason , but after trying out the UL80VT \'s track pad and comparing the two . It was night and day . The UL80VT \'s was immediately responsive and the two-finger scrolling worked perfectly pretty much all the time . I have sorely missed two-finger scrolling since getting rid of my Macbook Pro a year ago . I am very glad that PCs are starting to make it standard on the majority of notebooks today . Unfortunately , the HP dm3z did not have good enough drivers to make the two-finger scrolling worthwhile . One thing that I really liked about the dm3z is that it had an excellent keyboard with zero flex and it included media control buttons for the function keys ( like Dell Studio 14z ) . I would definitely recommend the dm3z to people as long as you understand that it is going to produce a lot of heat ( especially while watching video/playing games ) , the track pad is just going to be so-so , and you are n\'t going to achieve the same battery life you would if you went with the UL80VT ( unless you went with the intel version with integrated graphics ) . I began searching for a new laptop shortly after I found paint chipping on my Dell Studio 14z . It was frustrating since I try to take excellent care of my laptops and chipped paint tends to bring the resale value of laptops down tremendously . All in all , I found my experience with the 14z to be a good one and would recommend the laptop to someone who has a strict budget and ca n\'t afford a UL80VT . With the dell , I was typically able to get about 3.5-4.5 hours of battery life ( 8-cell in windows 7 ) while surfing the internet-writing documents . The HP dm3z seems to get about 4.5 hrs of web surfing time . The Asus literally doubles the length of my time I am going to be away from the wall ( with both the HP and the Dell ... ) . My primary complaints with the Dell Studio 14z were related to the build quality ( paint chipping and noticeable keyboard flex that was causing me discomfort ) . I loved the back-lit keyboard and will miss that feature on the UL80VT , though I am a touch typist so it will make little difference in terms of actual functionality . I love the fact that my UL80VT has a DVD-RW because I like to watch DVDs at Starbucks that I rent from Redbox . I could n\'t do that with the 14z because it lacked an optical drive , but I can do that with the Asus . It should also be noted that the UL80VT has a better screen than both the Dell and the HP ( in my opinion ) . IN CONCLUSION After I discovered the flex , I began contemplating switching over to a Macbook Pro 13 \'\' . So I went to my local Best Buy to compare sizes , keyboard , touchpad , etc ... I got to the store and there was a bestbuy sales guy there that I got to know pretty well when I bought my Dell Studio 14z . I began explaining to him how the 14z had n\'t met my needs due to a sucky touch pad and paint chipping off for no reason , etc . I pulled my UL80VT out of my bag and explain to him the features of the laptop ( i.e . switchable graphics , 10 hour battery life ) . I loaded up Batman Arkham Asylum and he was amazed that it played smoothly at native resolution . I showed him squeaky palm rest and explained to him I was considering getting a 13 \'\' Macbook Pro . He responded pretty quickly that he did n\'t think that apple would have anything that would be an upgrade from this so just recommended that I just stick with the Asus ... ( lol and he \'s a sales guy that is supposed to sell laptops for best buy , not recommend for me not to buy them ... lol ) I agree with the guy at Best Buy . Apple \'s got nothing on the Asus UL80VT ... except maybe better build quality , poorer performance , and a $ 500 dollar increase in price .

709,21_7_R3A91BPDWZIN0Z.txt,' `` Lord of the Flies \'\' is singularly the most important novel for required reading , whether assigned in school or self-imposed . It regularly appears as number one on my own list of best books . Let \'s play `` What if . \'\' What if a plane carrying a full load of school boys crashes on a deserted island with no adult survivors ? What would happen to those boys ? What would you expect to happen ? William Golding works with this premise : an idyllic setting , innocent schoolboys . One boy , an older boy just short of teenage years , a boy with fair hair , assumes leadership to stir the others into some semblance of organization and survival mode , much like adults would do if adults were present . He also saw a need to defuse the web of fear of the younger ones . Where are we ? How long will we need to wait before someone comes for us ? All questions with no answers at this time . Ah , yes , Golding tells us , everything goes well for a while . But remember the `` scar \'\' made by the crashing plane ? Something ugly is on this island ( but it \'s not the scar ) . It \'s in the bushes , in the dark , in the depths , in the depths of hearts , and it grows like the malignancy it is . A blatant revelation of what is about to come occurs when Roger silently and stealthily watches a young\'un , unbeknownst to the little child . All the young\'un is doing is running a stick through the sand , disturbing a crab in a tiny pool of water . Even he imposes control and fear on a helpless creature as Roger boldly picks up a couple of rocks and tosses them the youngster \'s way . He deliberately misses but comes closer with each throw . Next time he will probably hit the young boy , but not yet . This taboo -- deliberately and unnecessarily causing pain to one smaller than you -- has not been broken -- yet . Although the dance of the spears , the primeval chants , the attack and killing of the pig , then feasting on its flesh , their kill , are shocking acts of savagery , this event is foreshadowed by the seemingly innocent lob of the stones . From a casual incident , but one with eventual intentionality , the ritualistic slaughter is not so far-fetched or surprising . Golding prepares his readers . This is how the chaos of society starts . It begins with one simple disconnect from the rules . It begins in the minds and hearts . Will I do what society expects ? Will I follow the rules to keep things running and working ? Do I break a rule or two for my own enhancement . Will I feel a power surge if my rock hits that young ` un ? Ralph would probably speak of the terror of knowing that rules WILL be broken . He would speak of the utter horror that any rule can be and will be broken and he wo n\'t live to tell about it . Just ask Piggy . This novel is the only one I taught over and over during the twelve years I worked with high school seniors . My other choices I would switch around those years , drop some , add some . This one I kept . It is that important . I think of `` Lord of the Flies \'\' as a necessary manual for societal behavior and an effort to keep the chaos of evil at bay . Is it even necessary to ask how many times that rock has been thrown since this novel was published in the 1950 \'s ? Or how much chaos has imploded so many lives ? Like the way of manuals , some remain in circulation and are deeply read ; others fall by the wayside out of disinterest . Some are thrown in the trash . `` Lord of the Flies \'\' -- what is its current status ? And society -- how is it doing ? Reader , are you a little bit fearful ? ',normal

711,29_5_R1B8AJTIQ2O97Q.txt,' The sick thing is , no matter how repetitious and predictable this game is , I ca n\'t stop playing . If you \'re reading this and do n\'t know what `` Puzzle Quest \'\' is , I \'m honestly surprised . Go read my review of the first game and know that this one is ... Well , kind of different . Too lazy ? Okay . `` Puzzle Quest \'\' is `` Bejeweled \'\' crossed with `` Dungeons & Dragons . \'\' But not D & D 4e ; no d20 systems here or anything . This is all about matching three things and winning . Except , you can win . This is an epic advancement over the first game . The original `` Puzzle Quest \'\' would string four- and five-length matches together repeatedly until you were dead . Sometimes you did n\'t even get to play a round before you lost . You would click on an opponent , challenge them , and immediately face a screen explaining that you \'ve lost . `` Puzzle Quest 2 \'\' fixes this . I \'m certain the game is still cheating , but to make up for it , the game also has artificial idiocy programmed . Every so often , it skips an opportunity to run your face into an orc \'s backside , allowing you the chance to run the computer \'s face into an orc \'s backside . The problem is , who cares ? It \'s still just `` Bejeweled \'\' and were n\'t we supposed to be tired of that in 2005 ? I guess not , because I \'m still matching fist gems together to earn enough action points to throw a knife into a goblin \'s eyeball . The other major change is everything else . Instead of clicking on a map and moving to a point on a giant board game overview , now you stomp around in an isometric view like that old NES wizarding game , `` Snake Rattle & Roll . \'\' While `` Snake Rattle & Roll \'\' had you bouncing around garish neon landscape eating smaller snakes to grow bigger , here you \'re slowly plodding through a garish neon dungeon eating smaller enemies to earn basic ingredients to upgrade your own equipment . Very slowly plodding . On the upside , because this world is made of magic and electronic bits , there \'s a guideline constantly pointing you toward the next quest goal , so even when you \'re lost , you \'re not . Man , I wrote way more about this stupid game than I thought I would . And that angers me . It angers me that I \'m still playing it and it angers me that I could type this much . Because I do n\'t really like the game . There \'s no plot , only one town , and the game totally cheats when you \'re playing the looting minigame . But I want to get back to playing it now , for some reason . So , you know , whatever . It \'s okay . ',ironisch

With his left hand he would grip my waist - I was always cooking dinner - and press the cold frostiness of the jug against my arm as he kissed my cheek .

714,7_16_RDWQC5RXQNQ8P.txt,' In college I went through a phase where I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories . Once I got started reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle \'s stories , I did n\'t want to stop . It was sad when I read the last story . Now years later it was fun to read them again . I enjoy the Sherlock Holmes short stories more than one of the novels . For me one of the most enjoyable parts of a Sherlock Holmes story is reading about what happened , and then reading how Sherlock Holmes solved the problem . A collection of short stories provides this experience many times . This collection has many classics . It has the famous line `` It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth . \'\' ( The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet . ) It is also interesting to see what life was like in England 100 years ago .

And I \'m not 12 years old , mind you , and neither are many of the other people who found & quot ; Middle of Nowhere & quot ; likable -- many adults like Hanson , too . I do n\'t care how many CDs you have , and I do n\'t care about your life story , either . You \'ve got to relize something about Hanson and & quot ; Middle of Nowhere & quot ; . This was written/co-written and co-produced by the band Hanson themselves , when Ike was 16 , Tay was 14 , and when Zac was 11 . You have got to be crazy not to think that these boys ( yes , they are boys ) are talented . You have to admit it , even if you do n\'t like their music . What \'s more , they play their own instruments . Why do n\'t you go bother BSB or * N SYNC or something because , unlike the hard working Hanson bros. , they do n\'t write their music , they do n\'t write their lyrics , they do n\'t play instruments for their music , and their music is n\'t good anyway . But take & quot ; M.O.N. & quot ; : It \'s not my favorite , but I really like it a lot . The songs were written from the band \'s personal expriences ( & quot ; With You In Your Dreams & quot ; and & quot ; MMMBop & quot ; - you just have to listen to the words ) and what teens really feel and think ( & quot ; Weird & quot ; , & quot ; Thinking of You & quot ; , ect. , ect. ) . All * N SYNC ever sings about is breaking up with some girl , still loving that girl , and wanting her back . One theme . On one of Hanson \'s very mature songs , & quot ; Weird & quot ; ( which happens to be my favorite Hanson song ) , they sing about feeling left out and wishing someone was there who understood them . I do n\'t care how old you are , everyone has felt that why or will feel that way or do feel that way . & quot ; Thinking of You & quot ; is about a boy with a crush on some girl , but ca n\'t be with her ( I guess because he ca n\'t tell her how he feels about her ) . Everyone feels like that . & quot ; With You In Your Dreams & quot ; was written by Hanson alone for their dieing grandmother . I do n\'t care what you say , these boys DO have talent , even if you think this CD is bad or good !

720,17_1_RIJ6SMD51D61J.txt,' I received the Mr. Beer kit for Xmas , and it \'s a good system overall . It serves as a very good introduction to home brewing , but it does have some downsides as well . Good bits : -The system is about as easy as it could be . -The instructions are clear and simple . -The fermenting tank is small ( 2 gallons ) , meaning that you do n\'t have to wait around for a long time to taste the final product . With your more normal 5 gallon kits , you have to bottle a LOT of beer , and wait a bit longer for fermentation . -There \'s dozens of mixes available on their homepage , and they offer a lot of quality products at reasonable prices . Join their club to avoid the expensive shipping charges . Not so good bits : -The fermenter is almost too simple . A proper airlock design would make it more foolproof as to tell when fermenting is complete , as well as avoiding contamination of the beer . -The included mixes , while of good quality , produce a rather poor beer by comparison to what it is possible to make with the kit . Their website has a lot better product than what they include in the kit , and this gives some people bad impressions of the kit itself . The fault is not with the kit , but with the very basic starter beer in the package . The separate mixes they sell in stores are not much better , being all very basic brews . They \'re not bad , but they \'re not great either . Mediocre at best . -Sterilization ( which is possibly the most important part of home brewing ) is difficult because the fermenter is not dishwasher safe . A higher quality plastic that could stand high temperatures would be a better overall choice for the fermenting keg , since automatic dishwashers are a great way to sterilize your equipment easily . My suggestions on how to use this kit correctly : -Go to their website and pick up some of the more advanced receipes instead of using the mixes as given initially . If you \'ve used those included mixes , do n\'t be disappointed overall , it \'s that the mixes are very basic . Using the better receipes and the better ingredients , you can make quite incredible brews . -Keep the fermenter in an enclosed dark space during the fermenting process . I recommend a large cooler . This avoids contamination of the product as well as keeping it at a steady temparature . -Be very , very careful to sterilize completely . The OneStep cleanser they include is very good , but you do have to use it properly . Read the instructions and be sure that everything gets cleaned extremely well . -No matter what the instructions say , bottle conditioning takes longer than a week . Really . Wait 2 weeks , preferably 4 , before you crack the first bottle . The beer only gets better the longer you let it mature in the bottles . -Go easy on the sugar . Too much sugar in the bottles and they will explode , or taste like cider . If you use the kit as intended and with a careful eye for cleanliness , then you can produce some excellent quality brews in a very short time . But follow those instructions precisely . Anything less will result in poor quality brews . -- -- After using it for over a year , I have some more things to add : - DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE LID . The lid must allow the gases produced MUST escape . This is especially true with their higher alcohol mixes and stouts . If you overtighten , the end result will be spilled beer and a ruined keg . I brewed a dopplebock using the keg , and overtightened it . Result : The keg overpressurized and almost burst . Some foam came out of the top of the keg , and spilled into my cooler . The residue , once it dried , provided food for .. well .. not so nice creatures . The keg was naturally unusable afterwards . However , this was my own fault , and a new keg only cost me $ 10 through the Mr. Beer website , so it was not a total loss . And the beer ( since it was not contaminated due to the pressure differential , I bottled it anyway ) turned out to be absolutely spectacular . So whatever you do , do n\'t tighten it too much . A little hand pressure for tightening is enough . - Again , go easy on the sugar when bottling ! Somebody told me that they had one of the plastic bottles burst on them and the remainder tasted like cider . This is the result of excessive sugar in the bottling process . I highly recommend you get the sugar measure that they sell , if you are bottling in the 12oz , 22oz , or 1 liter sizes . The sugar measure is very easy to use and exact in nature . Takes out the measurements and guesswork . - Finally , I do not recommend normal bottles with a capper . These are difficult to use and contrary to popular belief , do not produce better beer . The screw top bottles are simplest because they hold the pressure in properly and are trivially simple to use . Alternatively , Mr. Beer sells 16 oz `` Grolsch style \'\' bottles on their site , which are the rubber grommeted wired cappers , and they work very well . If you must bottle with glass , get those . Or go find similarly capped bottles of beer and use those bottles ( after dishwashing , of course ) . Glass is much easier to sterilize because it \'s disahwasher safe . Just take the rubber caps off first . ',normal
1030,9_20_R373IMM2CPYUVQ.txt,' The revolution I refer to is the one that followed in the wake of the original publication of this book in 1961 . Ellis formally introduced his REBT therapeutic model in 1955 , but at the time , few knew and fewer cared . However , this book would change that forever . No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like `` The Power of Positive Thinking \'\' , because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before . First , we do n\'t just `` get \'\' upset , we `` do \'\' upset . Or , in other words , we make ourselves emotionally disturbed . Second , the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset . We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational ( aka , unhealthy , self-defeating ) thinking . And third , Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns . The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive , emotive and behavioral categories , although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason , as the authors point out , that we do n\'t just think or feel or behave in a vacuum . Rather , we are thinking/feeling/behaving beings , and this interplay , luckily enough , offers us many ways to a `` profound philosophic change \'\' in our outlook , which is the goal of this work .

722,39_12_R1NUI5XI7XLBP7.txt,' I began my search for an LCD HDTV/Monitor over a month ago and purchased 4 other similar items before purchasing this ViewSonic VT2430 and returned the previous 4 for poor performance . I was actually looking for a unit which included a DVD player for use in training lectures . But , I could n\'t find the right combination so I decided to settle on a unit without the DVD player , since those that are built in are all cheap players . This way , by keeping the TV and the DVD player separate I can always update the player as needed ( BlueRay ! ) . I looked at a LOT of HDTV/Monitors and chose the VT2430 for its native 1920x1080 pixel resolution . This works out perfectly with the 1920x1080i signals coming via my cable . And ... the pictures are absolutely stunning ! More so than I even expected , even already knowing the quality of Viewsonic monitors . And there are plenty of options for modifying and managing the images from all inputs . One reason for returning a Toshiba unit was that it \'s native resolution is 1680x1050 pixels , which , when fed a 1920x1080 pixel signal ( HDTV ) stretches the image vertically ... without any way of correcting the distortion . In fact , the manual states that `` image size adjustments are not available with 720i and 1080i signals \'\' ! VERY poor planning as most cable signals are either 790i or 1080i . The PC image obtained with the VT2430 is absolutely awesome . I \'m typing this review with this monitor with the resolution set at 1920x1080 , a perfect match with my PC . There are at least 10 other resolution settings that work as well - just lower resolution results . Regardless of the resolution sent from my PC , the VT2430 automatically adjusts for the best picture with each setting . Very neat . The audio was another problem I found with all of the other units I tried . Most of them were either too low in volume or , when the volume was turned up became very distorted . Not so with the VT2430 . Plenty of clean sound at all volume settings , including loud enough for filling the rooms where I do my training . The image I get from my ( LG ) DVD player , which upgrades to a 1080i output via an HDMI cable , is very good . I also have a BlueRay player which puts out a 1080p signal , which , again , perfectly matches the resolution of the VT2430 , for a beautiful picture . The overall picture of this monitor is far more accurate , clean , and viewable than any of the other monitors I looked at . The dynamic range is very wide , including the darker colors and grays and blacks , not quite up to my 52-in Samsung ( Over $ 2,300 ! ) , but closer than any other comparable sized monitor . Physically , I like the fact that the monitor can be tilted back for watching from higher positions . Also , the flat stand can be quickly removed for transporting in its original box , which I do often when I \'m training . Great monitor . I would recommend it to anyone . I would , however , downgrade its rating by 1/2 point for not having a DVD player . But , that is not what it is ! ViewSonic does sell an LCD HDTV/DVD Combo monitor , but it has a lower pixel rate designed more for 720i resolution , which is OK for most uses at this smaller size . But , having been a TV studio tech in charge of adjusting and maintaining studio monitors , I became too picky and always need ( ! ) the best . ',normal

As Old Order Establishments , such as Christianity , painfully pass away , New Religions rush in to fill the Void and & quot ; Rationalism & quot ; is one of them . The Old Order was convinced that there was something & quot ; wrong & quot ; with being human , ( i.e .

Apparently , Klosterman tried to be one of those hyper-intense coaches who tried to work out his own personal daddy issues by trying to turn a team of 9 year olds into a finely tuned baseball machine . Because this did n\'t work out , and Klosterman might have a problem with women , soccer will never make it big in America . Um , okay . - Klosterman \'s discussion of math and probability would embarass a stoned 16 year old with it \'s facile reasoning . - Like other writers of his generation , of which I am part , Klosterman has somehow confused an obsession with , and Rainman like recall of , certain pop culture elements ( cereal , Saved by the Bell , The Real World ) with actual knowledge and understanding . Perhaps one day he will read a book or see a movie created before the 1960s . ',ironisch
729,18_8_R223LYA2UGWGGL.txt,' Having never owned - or even so much as used - a webcam prior to this , I do n\'t have much point of reference . That said , the installation of this product could n\'t have been any easier . On my older desktop system , the installation only took a few minutes . The laptop I have is much newer , and the software installed even faster . Absolutely trouble-free , and within minutes I had a picture on screen and was able to take photos and make videos . The adjustable clip on the back of the camera is very effective - it doubles as a stand , which came in handy on my bulky old non-flat screen monitor . On my laptop screen it was just as handy , resting firmly in place at the top of the screen . I was truly impressed by the video quality . Again , I \'ve never owned a webcam previously , but I \'ve viewed many webcam videos posted on websites - and I was aware that the image quality ran the gamut . The lens on this webcam produces a very sharp , detailed image . Even in relatively low-lighting , the picture was n\'t bad at all . On my several years old desktop , the image did n\'t keep up with the movements very well - moving my head from side to side , for instance , resulted in quite a blur . But on my newer laptop , that blur was reduced extremely - the movements registered in more or less real-time . The auto-focus feature seems to do it \'s job pretty well , and makes operation very simple . The audio quality was definitely less impressive than the picture - but it was right in line with what I expected for a little tiny built-in microphone . Loud noises clip and/or distort - I tried playing my saxophone and the result was n\'t listenable ( though some would say that \'s due to my playing ability ) . Yelling , or even extremely loud talking , clips . But all things considered , when remaining at a distance of a couple feet and talking at a normal , even volume - the audio quality was very acceptable . I got a kick out of the various visual features . There are a bunch of filters - my favorite is the \'50s style , creating a vintage black-and-white scratched up film look . Neonize was a trip - darkening everything on screen except for neon-colored borders to everything . The \'ghost \' filter gives a blurred tracer effect to all movement . I do n\'t know how much need I \'ll have for these , but they \'re fun to mess around with . There are also a bunch of options to change the look of your face on-screen - including \'robot face \' which makes you look like a cyborg or something . I do n\'t honestly know what the \'avatar \' feature was supposed to do - I aligned my face within the red box like it said to , but nothing really happened ever once I initiated the feature ... Bottom line - speaking for total , complete , 100 \% webcam novices like myself : this is a quality webcam that I could not imagine being easier to use . The video quality is top-notch . My biggest criticism - and this is actually kind of minor - is the utter lack of a storage case or pouch for the webcam . I do n\'t plan to leave mine out all the time and I \'d like to keep the lens ( rightfully rated highly ) in good shape . For the time being , I \'m actually putting it back in the box but even a cheap felt pouch would \'ve been nice . ',normal

733,50_3_R1JX83CAAYPFZK.txt,' I recieved this filter with my Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System for Christmas this year , so I can not review its durability . I have some worries based on the previous reviews , but I \'ll hope for the best . As far as the coffee this makes , it is great . Of course , it greatly depends on the coffee you use . The coffee I find myself using most in the filter is Peet \'s Major Dickason \'s Blend , but I \'ve tried many others and they are all superb . It is hard to believe , but this produces a cup of coffee just as good as a K-Cup . It is nice to be able to fill it to the very top to get a nice strong cup , as well as use coffees not available in K Cups . It also saves a lot of money . I try to use this more than K Cups and that will keep the expense of K Cups low enough for me . Note : Many reviews specify a type of grind , but I find that a medium grind that you would find in a bag of pre-ground works great . Also , filling it to the top leaving a little room works best for me . If this lasts a reasonable amount of time , it is certainly worth the price to replace it . UPDATE : I have already reviewed this product . I got it this Christmas with a Keurig B40 . I got a `` good \'\' my k cup . I was worried by the bad reviews about it breaking . Clearly , some of these are made faulty . I found this when i bought a second so I would n\'t have to wash the first over and over . I got a `` bad \'\' one . These filters are great , unless you get a bad one . Before you use your new filter , make sure that the top EASILY tightens onto the filter . If it does , you have a good one . If it is difficult , return it go get another . If your are buying in store , check first . If you own a Keurig , you need one of these , but make sure you get the right one ! ( UPDATE : 6 months later ; the filter still works great , but I have found that only coarsely ground coffee will work without it getting clogged . If you are using medium/fine ground coffee and it gets clogged , leaving you with little coffee , use coarsely ground . It took me a while to figure this out . Now it works every time . ',normal
734,20_9_RKC5U9Q04XUEW.txt,' Wow EA really jacked this one up . Sims 2 was probably the single greatest wide interest game ever made . Appealing to everyone from 8 year old kids to baby-boomers , there was so much right about the game ( ease of use , the fun of designing and building custom houses , the excellent expansion packs , the fantastic user made content , etc . ) that perhaps it would be unfair to expect Sims 3 to be better than Sims 2 . However , I AT LEAST expected it to be playable , and reasonably similar to Sims 2 in quality and fun . To sum up the rest of this review : It \'s nowhere close . It stinks . It \'s unplayable due to crashes ( for me at least ) . It \'s a buggy , unfun , massive step backwards from Sims 2 . So what makes it so bad ? First off , the game crashes nearly constantly . It is not my computer . I own and successfully play dozens of computer games including the most graphics intensive on the market . ( For the nerds , I have a i7 processor , 6gb ram , and crossfired ATI HD4870s ) . These problems are due to buggy code and terrible beta testing . This game should never have been released in this state of unfinished unplayability . They have also removed many of the things I liked best about Sims two like the ability to construct a neighborhood from scratch and then play each family and watch your Sims interact , make friends and enemies , get married to each other , etc ... You are now forced to play a single family at a time . Start a new family and your old ones become NPCs ( non player controlled ) characters . You can never go back once you start a new one . Why EA , why ? This singlehandedly ruined the game for me . Next is the drastic step backwards in ease and fun of playability . Why they decided to jack with the control mechanisms that every Sims 2 player is accustomed to , or slow time down to the point that I started falling asleep watching my Sim sleep with nothing to do in the game to keep me interested , and why EA released the game with a deplorably low number of home furnishings , I do n\'t know . It \'s like a horrible nightmare where instead of games progressing and improving , they \'re regressing towards oblivion . The menus are just clumsy , hard to use , and so very much worse than Sims 2 . If you loved the Sims 2 menus , you will HATE these . The camera is also bad , in that sort of early generations Nintendo 64 way where you can never get it to do what you want it to do with regularity . It seems to have a mind of its own , and controlling it is as frustrating as the terrible controls . Making attractive Sims is about as easy as sculpting the masterpiece David from play dough . All my Sims look fat , ugly , and just not what I had in mind . It is Uber hard to get a face the way you want it to look . It is even harder to make a nice looking Sim than the character creation system in Oblivion : The Elder Scrolls . If you like plump , slightly froggish looking Sims , you \'ll love it . For interior design , rather than giving you a solid and complete set of home furnishings , you are instead offered very few selections , but the ability to make them patterned . Oh joy ! What I really want is about 6 options of sofas , most of them ugly , but that I can apply plaid or camouflage skins to ! That \'s so much better than having say 12 sofa varieties right ? Not so much . This strikes me as either laziness , or that EA released the game intentionally sparse so they can sell even more add on packs later . Except they missed the entire point : the reason they sold so many add on packs for Sims 2 was that the core game was so good ! Overall this might be one of the worst failures in modern PC game history . Destroying a famed ( even legendary ) series of games like the Sims franchise by changing core elements and just doing a flat out poor job of quality control is abysmal . EA will need to heavily patch this game to make it worth playing , and by the time they do that , it might be too late . My recommendation : sell your copy on an auction site . At least then you can get back some of your money and buy something else . ',ironisch

742,3_20_R33PA93KTJPCNE.txt,' Hey kids ! If you \'re looking for music that \'s as satisfying and refreshing as a frozen sugar cube , deeper than a pool that \'s a foot deep and more exciting than watching paint dry , look no further than Rihanna \'s album , A Girl Like Me ! Listen to her wonderful studio-altered , digitally processed voice ! Gasp at the thought-provoking lyrics about needing to be rescued , falling in love and wanting to make love all night long ! Marvel at the synths , bleeps and squiggly sound effects that represent real reggae ! Forget no-good corporate hacks like Bob Marley , Peter Tosh , Dennis Brown , Damian Marley , I Wayne and Sizzla , because Rihanna is the real deal and she wants you , boys ! What an astounding , brilliant , masterfully crafted work of perfection ! I like music , and I like Rihanna ! She \'s just as brilliant as amazing artists like Britney Spears , Good Charlotte and Simple Plan ! They should all tour together , how great would that be ? ... ... Alright , enough already . I ca n\'t keep this facade up any longer . That was just me channeling one of those incredibly enthusiastic , overzealous Rihanna marks that think she \'s the greatest thing since sliced bread . I wholeheartedly beg to differ . While her work ethic is to be commended somewhat ( second album in 8 or 9 months , but all she contributes is her weak vocals ) , A Girl Like Me is just another example of what \'s gone so horrible wrong with the music industry - the fact that labels still insist on pushing shallow disposable rubbish on everyone . Essentially what is wrong with this album is presented in the first paragraph as backhanded compliments . On top of this , the fact that Rihanna is just another Beyonce wannabe ( who herself is a Diana Ross wannabe ) just makes matters worse - the overuse of melismas on this album is enough to drive any sane person mad . But what makes this album a special type of awful is the fact that it is being marketed as reggae . Now , there \'s some people that feel that modern reggae artists ( such as Elephant Man , Sean Paul , even Matisyahu ) do n\'t hold a candle to the originators ( like Marley and Tosh ) , but I have grown to enjoy it and recognize it as the evolution of the genre . However , Rihanna is as close to reggae as a band like Fall Out Boy is to punk - in other words , the term reggae must be used VERY loosely . An occasional Caribbean drum flourish and use of the dialect does not a reggae song make . This is much closer to a hybrid of Beyonce and Britney Spears , right down to keeping the barely legal Rihanna \'s wardrobe budget low by having her prance around in only the skimpiest of outfits . I can just imagine these comments from the director at one of her video shoots : `` Hey , Rihanna , what are you doing out here in your underwear ? Did n\'t that outfit that we ordered arrive yet ? What \'s that ? The record label would n\'t front the money to cover the cost of the wardrobe ? Oh well , I guess we \'ll shoot anyway . One thing is certain : The teenage boys will love this video . `` . In summary : A Girl Like Me is only worth checking out if you ca n\'t get enough of banal , vacuous pop garbage . This is not reggae , ska , soca , etc . It \'s bubblegum pop , and it \'s a style that has run its course and is becoming very irritating . It \'s easy to market , and that \'s why MTV is playing the video every 10 minutes . Speaking of the single , it \'s really just juvenile lyrics buttressed by the melody of Soft Cell \'s version of `` Tainted Love \'\' - nothing special at all . The rest of the album is equally shallow pop with only a slight Caribbean influence , bookended by remixes of songs from Rihanna \'s last album . I urge you to look past MTV and `` hit music \'\' stations to find better music , reggae or otherwise . ',ironisch

Our previous model , with its multiple speakers and tangle of wires , was a `` true \'\' 5.1 surround sound . I have never been crazy about stringing up speaker wire , and the setup of our living room meant that it was bound to look unsightly . I wanted this sound system to do 2 things : look nice and produce good sound , and it has delivered on both very well . The look is sleek . The CD tray sits behind the front panel , which slides aside when opening ( that got an `` oohhh \'\' from the kids ) . The connecting wires were minimal . The system draws its power from the sub-woofer , requiring a single outlet . The weight of the main bar is probably less than 20 pounds , with the majority of the weight of the whole system in the sub-woofer , which rests of the floor `` at least 3 feet \'\' from the bar . The bar rests easily on top of an entertainment center , but should not pose much problem to mount on a wall below a wall-mounted flat panel TV . It accommodates HDTV and non-HDTV , can synch with the TV cable sound , has an MP3 jack , and has AM/FM radio receivers . As for the sound , I \'d rate it quite good for the money . The set-up includes a brief series of questions regarding the room layout relative to the sound bar . I assume this calibrates it for a `` sweet spot \'\' where the sound most closely recreates a surround effect . I \'m not an audiophile , but I \'d call it a `` surround lite \'\' . It gives the sound an impression of depth that is pleasing , and the bass is deep enough to make the THX test pattern enjoyable ( my personal test of `` good enough \'\' ) . If you are an audio purist , this is probably not the system for you , but it was a real crowd-pleaser at our house for family movie night . So , for an easy , eye pleasing setup and very good sound in an affordable package , I strongly recommend the Phillips AmbiSound system . ',normal

As an author , I know how much they can sting , and I try to limit myself to only reviewing books I \'ve really enjoyed . However , since the author is long dead , I doubt I can hurt her feelings . And if by my words I can possibly prevent one other person from undergoing the suffering I \'ve endured , I \'ll feel that my job here is done . I decided that at the age of 52 , it was time I started reading some of the classics that I \'d missed along the way . I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE first , and though I found Ms. Austen \'s writing to be tedious , the book was mildly entertaining . I thought I \'d try Emily Bronte \'s WUTHERING HEIGHTS next . I \'d always heard how romantic the story was , and no less than three people , upon seeing me with the book , told me , `` You \'ll love it ! You \'ll absolutely love it ! \'\' Please tell me you \'re kidding . This book is wretched . Painful to a degree I \'ve never before experienced . I \'ve read books that put me to sleep , books I found impossibly dull , books I found too stupid for words . But I have NEVER hated a book so much in my life . The characters in their entirety do n\'t possess a single redeeming value . They are miserable , obnoxious , hateful excuses for human beings . Even the DOGS are hateful . Why should I care what happens to any of these awful people ? Why should I care if they \'ve made themselves miserable through their own choices and then spend the rest of the book whining and complaining about how pathetic their lives are ? I had n\'t realized just how much I loathed them until halfway through the book , when a major character died , and all I could think was , `` THANK GOD ! THANK GOD ! \'\' And then , there \'s the dialect . Ah , the dialect ! I could tolerate it if it was used sparingly . But when a certain character goes into a speech that lasts for half a page of small print , in a language that can only be described as Not Even Resembling English ( yes , I know it \'s supposed to be Scottish ) , the result is unbearable pain . Every time this character speaks ( which is , thankfully , not often ) , I find myself puzzling over his words in an attempt to translate them into something that seems even mildly coherent . Sometimes , it \'s possible to do this just by context . At other times , I shake my head in bewilderment and disgust and simply move on to a different page . Considering how slowly the story moves ( is there a storyline ? a point to all this suffering ? ) , I could probably skip entire chapters and not miss anything . I \'d also like to know where the romance is . Since everybody in this book seems to hate everybody else , with the notable exception of the uncouth monster , Heathcliff , and the spoiled-rotten , obnoxious Catherine , I ca n\'t fathom where that might lie . Am I too dense to understand ? Or has the literary world been tricking us for 150 years , convincing the sheep of the world to follow along in praise of this `` romantic \'\' classic ? I think I would rather have my fingernails pulled out forcefully , one at a time , than finish reading this book . I \'m halfway through , and life is short .

758,26_12_R7TKSUWIU1YAI.txt,' Ok , let \'s start with the top question : Do you or I really need another upgrade of Photoshop Elements ? Is it vastly different than ( 6.0 or 7.0 ) and should this be my digital photo editing and organizing software of choice ? I will cover the main points of the changes from Version 6.0 and 7.0 in this review . I have also reviewed Photoshop Premiere Elements 8 which is the video editor , and comes as a package option with Photoshop Elements 8 . Photoshop Elements has two components -- an editor , where you do your digital picture manipulation , and a file organizer or album where you store and retrieve your images . The interface for the editor is the same whether or not you use Mac or Windows , so if you are switching from one OS ( say , MAC \'s at school , Windows at home ) you will be very comfortable with Photoshop Elements . Where the systems differ , however , is in the file organizer and this is understandable ; the Organizer function involves organizing and retrieving files , so this is going to be different depending on your computer operating system . Since I do n\'t have access to a MAC , and since I do n\'t know much about them , I \'m going to be reviewing the Windows version only from here on in this review . For your information , I \'m currently using Windows Vista 64 Home Premium Edition . My computer system used for this test is an HP Pavilion with an AMD Athlon 64X2 2.70 Dual Core CPU 5200+ . I have 4 GB of RAM . The Video card is NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 wtih 128 MB of video memory . This is an on-board video card ( on the motherboard ) and if you are doing heavy image work , and video , you might want a separate , more capable video card . Minimum PC Requirements : Windows XP , Windows Vista , or Windows 7 1.6GHz or faster processor 1GB RAM ( MINIMUM means MINIMUM ; you really will need 2GB of ram to be comfy ) 2GB available hard disk space Microsoft DirectX 9 Color monitor with 16-bit color video card Internet Access for online features and help One immediate , small but great change from Version 7.0 is that when the software is initially booted up , the Welcome Screen is rearranged ; on the left side : simple buttons EDIT or ORGANIZE . On the right , access to tutorials and underneath , info on your Photoshop online account ( space available , links to your personal URL and online organizer . ) Version 7.0 had tab buttons along the top of the welcome screen and was visually more confusing . THIS IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT . THANK YOU . A big change from Version 6.0 is the workspace , which is now dark gray in color ( I actually do n\'t like this -- the gray is depressing , but I understand visually it is far less distracting and lets you focus on your editing job . ) The workspace is now adjustable . However , if you are a change-o-phobic or just habit-bound , you can return the settings to look and feel like previous versions , for example , the fixed-window workspace of Version 6.0 can be retrieved in the Application Frame in the preferences window . There are other big changes , mainly the organizer , the online content , the personal online space and some editing tools ; more about these further on in this review . In addition to the change to the Welcome Screen , there are changes to the interface where you access your tools . The palettes have been renamed as `` panels \'\' so I got confused a bit again . I \'ve been using Palettes for years with editing software ; palettes of filters , layers , colors . So , now , they are PANELS , and you can do this right in the panel itself at the bottom . This is also a significant change from Version 6.0 ( 7.0 does have it . ) The big change to 7.0 however , is that the layer controls are now their own panel below the Layers panel . The old dialog boxes are being replaced by these drop-down panels . Getting down to brass tacks ; the biggest change from 6.0 to either version 7.0 or now 8.0 by far , is the Organizer . Not only is there an automatic `` organize my images for me \'\' feature , but there is an optional online storage feature that has many uses . The main change from 7.0 to 8.0 has to do with an improved ability to add key word tags and to manage your media . If media management is an issue for you , this upgrade will be worth your while . Another big change in Version 8.0 : do you open multiple files at a single session ? ( I often download a photo session from say , a parade or one event . ) Beforehand , you \'d have to go to the file list in `` Open Files \'\' and pick which ones or all the ones you want , and try to scroll through them at the bottom to find the photo you want . Now you can open multiple files and use tabs to switch between them . This is huge . If you do n\'t like point-and-click , you can employ a keyboard shortcut of Command-~ ( tilde ) to page through the open files . The main change to Version 8.0 is the Organizer . When you boot up the software and have those choices , Edit or Organize , initially you are asked to set up an online account at Photoshop.com . You do n\'t HAVE to do this . And you are then asked if you want to organize your photos , and this is the real advantage ; the system combs through your hard drive and pulls up your images , and organizes them ( like Picasa and other organizing programs ) into a set of albums . The last six months are available with a single click , or you can organize by other means . If you key-word tag your photos when saving them , and use the Smart Tags ( everything from photo quality ( good , bad , over , underexposed , face , etc ) to event tags , you can create albums and quickly export them to DVD , CD , online albums , or hard drive . If you do a lot of image work and do n\'t want your main hard drive cluttered with images , or if you want to back up your images onto an external drive , this is very handy . The organizer is one major reason to move from 6.0 to 8.0 . Organizing a large number of photographs is made seamless and easy with the organizer that appeared in Version 7.0 . I didnt think Id need it , but I do need it and I use it . In fact , I need to get better at using the tag feature . This is very good for the increasingly difficult task of finding and retrieving older photos . You get 2GB free storage online at Adobe Photoshop.com \'s site , so if you sign up ( as is suggested in the Welcome Screen ) , you can have an offsite , online backup . If 2GB is not enough storage for you , you can pay for Plus membership . Plus Membership starts at around twenty bucks ( at this time ) and you can go from 20GBmb ( about 4 hours of video storage ) to 40 , 100 , 250 or 500GB of storage , with prices rising accordingly . There are other perks such as advanced tutorials , and some bonus art and video effects , but the main reason for upgrading from free is to obtain much more online storage . I used some of the themes for the slide show and there are a few included , so the temptation is very strong to spring for the extra twenty bucks , get the ten-fold increase in storage ( easy to fill it up ) as well as the larger selection of themes . If you use Premiere , the adjunct video editing , you get increased storage for videos , and movie theme materials for `` instant movies . \'\' I will be reviewing Premiere 8.0 separately , but you can see that if you intend to use the complete image-plus-video package , you probably will want a Plus membership . I was surprised to find out ( me , the minimalist ) that I did also want the upgrade . Film buffs and Youtube fanatics will want the extra storage ; video takes a lot of space , and you are permitted to upload a video of up to 2GB with basic membership . In version 7.0 , Adobe introduced a much-improved Photomerge funtion . I use this function a lot to make composite photos as well as panoramas and other interesting landscape creations and group photos . I was not happy with the previous Photomerge in versions 6.0 and prior , but I used it a lot as a shortcut to cut-and-paste multiple images to make a composite . Version 8.0 improves Photomerge and adds a very interesting and useful feature : you can combine several exposures to create the `` perfect \'\' digital exposure . Take one shot with flash and one without . ( Yes , the no-flash shot is too dark ; the flash shot is sometimes washed-out or the shadows look funny . ) Using PhotomMerge Exposure , you can get a new , improved `` best-of-both-worlds \'\' photograph . Here \'s my take : if you have Version 7.0 and you do a lot of photography , this is worth the upgrade alone . Two new editing tools , Recompose and Smart Brush , tools also are slick ways to merge and fix photos with a lot less fiddling around , or by using some smarts built into the software . For example , you can reformat a wide photograph , remove a lot of blank space and recompose it to have the figures closer together , but not distorted . I used to do this by a very involved cut-and-paste procedure , copying figures I wanted to move and covering over unsightly elements like road signs or utility poles ; this is a lot faster though I still need to do some clever editing myself if a pole appears `` growing \'\' out of the top of a subject \'s head ( a huge photographic boo-boo ) or if there is some goofy kid mooning you or mugging a funny face in the background of the shot ( I should n\'t be telling you this , but a fun way to ruin someone \'s vacation photograph is to sneak into the background as they compose their award-winning photo of the Eifel Tower or Mount Rushmore and cross your eyes and stick out your tongue . Kind of a human version of that intruding squirrel of internet fame . ) Using Recompose , you can remove these offensive things more easily . There are templates to make cards , calendars , frames and other artwork . I am not into that kind of thing , but it \'s there for those of you who do scrapbooking , especially digital scrapbooking or who make your own birthday cards or Christmas newsletters . I used the slideshow template and I loved it . I wanted more ... but the themes as I mentioned previously , are limited in the basic , included online edition . You have to spring for Plus membership to expand those selections of themes . No major changes to the filters . Pretty much the same as Version 6.0 , with the changes to controlling the interface as I mentioned before . The biggest change to filters is in the smart brushes for photographs . I have been using the filters a great deal ever since Elements was introduced , to pre-compose paintings from my digital photos . They seem pretty much the same as in earlier versions though the adjustments are now easier to manipulate in the Filter Gallery . This question comes up all the time : is 8.0 FASTER ? ? ? I did n\'t notice any difference loading 8.0 and 7.0 . Definitely , versions 7.0 and 8.0 are much faster to load than 6.0 , at least with my computer . Re tutorials , manuals and help ; as usual , help is online content though a pamphlet on Getting Started comes with the box of software . In addition to the online content for help , there is a `` Tips and Tricks \'\' hyperlink in the Welcome Screen ( lower right ) . This takes you online to a web page with tutorials . The tutorials include what \'s new in Version 8.0 , various help for video editing ( this will be covered in my review of Premiere Version 8.0 . ) You can search for other tutorials , and even submit your own . Tutorials have a rating on the right ( one to five stars . ) When you click on a particular tutorial , you will see the author , a way to favorite it for future reference , and on the right , you can add your own rating of it . Summary : Version 8.0 has a few great new improvements over Version 7.0 . It is not vastly different than 7.0 but the Recompose , PhotomMerge Exposure and some of the adjustments to the panels are advanced enough to make this a significant improvement if you like to do digital photography . It is quite different from Version 6.0 so if you have not upgraded and these features appeal to you , I think it would be well worth it to get the improved organizer and the improved tools . Recommendation : If you are on 6.0 or earlier versions and your PC meets the minimum requirements , do upgrade to 8.0 . If you are on Version 7.0 and employ the media organization , upgrade to 8.0 Joanna Daneman ',normal

1129,6_11_R3U5QR00VSNS3Q.txt,' This book is psycho-babble at its worst . ( Why five stars , then ? Read on ... ) The king , for example , is `` really \'\' a penis , and therefore the whole game is `` really \'\' an attempt at castration , because both players attempt to mate the enemy king . Castling is protecting one \'s penis from the castrating father because it `` hides away \'\' the game \'s `` penis \'\' . Riiiiiiiiight . The queen \'s power , on the other hand , shows the mother \'s female power , and players who tend to swap queens early are afraid of women . Well , either that , or they are stronger in queenless positions because they are better in positional endgames than in tactical ones . And what about languages where the piece is not called a `` queen \'\' at all , such as Arabic or Hungarian ? No matter -- the very fact that it \'s * powerful * is enough for it to symbolize the power of women . Again , Riiiiiiiiiight . Worse than such nonsense is Fine \'s buying of , apparently , every single tall tale of the `` crazy chess player \'\' kind and attributing the `` real reasons \'\' for the apocrypical story to deep-seated psychological problems . Hence Morphy \'s `` fetishism \'\' with women \'s shoes ( never happened ) or Alekhine \'s `` throwing \'\' a king across the room when he lost ( ditto ) `` prove \'\' their sexual masochism and/or sadism ; etc. , etc. , etc . The most puzzling part of the book is where Fine attribues deep , hidden psychological causes for * specific moves * masters made -- of course , `` proving \'\' them all deranged in some way or another ( all except himself , that is ) . A blunder is never a bluner , but only a result of a deep-seated , subconscious `` masochistic \'\' desire to be punished ( by that standard , I am the worst masochist in the world ... ) A move that makes many threats is n\'t just a ( usually ) good move , it shows the deep-seated `` agression \'\' of the player , while a quiet winning move shows his `` sadism \'\' . And so on and so forth . This sort of thing would , perhaps , be understandable if the writer was ignorant about chess . After all , total ignorance of , say , politics or economics did n\'t stop psychoanalysts from `` proving \'\' what the `` deep psychological reasons \'\' for war or capitalism ( or whatever ) `` really are \'\' . But Fine was a very strong player ! He , of all people , should have known that chess masters do not think like that . Of course his excuse is the pychoanalyst \'s eternal excuse : you may not * think * you think like that , but that just proves you \'re `` in denial \'\' about the `` deep subconscious roots \'\' of your actions . On the other hand a total stranger , like Dr. Fine , from decades and continents away , can effortly tell us the `` deep subconscious reasons \'\' some master `` really \'\' made a certain move . How did Fine aquire this magical ability ? From St. Freud , of course . For the third time : Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight . In short , this books does , indeed , show us something about the psychology of the chess player . It shows us just how confused and laughable an obviously intelligent man , and a very strong chess player to boot -- Dr. Fine himself -- could become once he fell into the silly dogmatic nonsense of Fruedian psychonalaysis . I therefore recommend you go right out and get the book ! You \'ll never find a better example of rip-roaringly unintentionally funny psycho-babble .

1177,14_10_RWWJ1CEX4Z1C8.txt,' From the opening pages of Tori Spelling \'s searing new memoir , `` Mommywood , \'\' readers will realize that we are in for a rare tale of pathos and depth .

She could not believe that this horrifying defect , which could well destroy Liam \'s Hollywood career before it even began , went unnoticed by her husband and doctor . Spelling knew it was vital that baby Liam have a perfect nose , because she had made the noble decision to record his every smile , poopy diaper , temper tantrum , and birthday bash for all of America -- no , the whole world -- to see . On her reality show `` Tori & Dean : Home Sweet Hollywood , \'\' which airs weekly on the Oxygen network , Spelling vents to fans about the tribulations of having two tiny children who are followed everywhere by the paparazzi she invited into their lives . In the book , she reveals her fascinating quest to lose the baby weight from Liam even while getting pregnant with her daughter Stella . She courageously opens up about her sex life . She trashes her mother \'s catty trashing of her and discusses Mom \'s shopping and wanton materialism . She reveals how , after redecorating their home , she realized it was far too small and bought a mansion instead .

772,45_14_R1CNIJUVB0JSEI.txt,' Based on reading Michael Lewis \' Liar \'s Poker and Moneyball , I wondered whether The Big Short would prove to be entertaining and informative . If you \'ve read some of Lewis \' books , you might agree that the `` entertaining \'\' part would seem to be a reasonably safe bet . It turns out , it is . The Big Short is fast-paced , straightforward , conversational and salty -- very much like his earlier works . Indeed , if you did n\'t know Michael Lewis had written this book , you could probably guess it . It is easy reading and very hard to put down . In short ( no pun ) , The Big Short does n\'t disappoint in being entertaining . In a sense , this book is similar to Moneyball in that Lewis tells his story by following a host of characters that most of us have never heard of -- people like Steve Eisman ( the closest thing to a main character in the book ) , Vincent Daniel , Michael Burry , Greg Lippmann , Gene Park , Howie Hubler and others . How informative is the book ? Well , it may seem that Lewis has his work cut out for himself , since the events of the recent financial crisis are already well known . More than that , lots of people have their minds made up concerning who the perps of the last few years are -- banks and their aggressive managers , `` shadow banks \'\' and their even more aggressive managers , hedge funds , credit default swaps , mortgage brokers , the ratings agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Fed \'s monetary policy , various federal regulators , short sellers , politicians who over-pushed home ownership , a sensationalist media , the American public that overextending itself with excessive borrowing ( or that lied in order to get home loans ) , housing speculators , etc . The list goes on -- and on . Okay , so you already know this . The defining aspect of this book , however , is that it asks ( and answers ) `` Who knew ? \'\' about the impending financial crisis beforehand . Who knew -- before the financial crisis cracked open for everyone to see ( and , perhaps , to panic ) in the fall of 2008 -- that a silent crash in the bond market and real estate derivatives market was playing out ? Indeed , the good majority of this book addresses events that occurred before Lehman \'s failure in September of 2008 . In describing what led up to the darkest days of the crisis , Lewis does a good job helping the reader to see how the great financial storm developed . All in all , this is an informative book . Interestingly , in the book \'s prologue , Salomon Brothers alumnus Lewis explains how , after he wrote Liar \'s Poker over 20 years ago , he figured he had seen the height of financial folly . However , even he was surprised by the much larger losses suffered in the recent crisis compared to the 1980s , which seem almost like child \'s play now . For a taste of The Big Short , Steve Eisman was a blunt-spoken `` specialty finance \'\' research analyst at Oppenheimer and Co. , originally in the 1990s , and he eventually helped train analyst Meredith Whitney , who most people associate with her string of negative reports on the banking industry , primarily from late 2007 . Giving a flavor of his style , Eisman claims that one of the best lines he wrote back in the early 1990s was , `` The [ XYZ ] Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial institution -- it loses money in every conceivable interest rate environment . \'\' His own wife described him as being `` not tactically rude -- he \'s sincerely rude . \'\' Vinny Daniel worked as a junior accountant in the 1990s ( and eventually worked for Eisman ) , and he found out how complicated ( and risky ) Wall Street firms were when he tried to audit them . He was one of the early analysts to notice the high default rates on manufactured home loans , which led to Eisman writing a 1997 report critical of subprime originators . Michael Burry ( later Dr. Michael Burry ) was , among other things , a bond market researcher in 2004 who studied Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger , and who correctly assessed the impact of `` teaser rates \'\' and interest rate re-sets on subprime loans . In 2005 , Burry wrote to his Scion Capital investors that , `` Sometimes markets err big time . \'\' How right he would be . Greg Lippmann was a bond trader for Deutsche Bank , who discussed with Eisman ways to bet against the subprime mortgage market . Before home prices declined , he noted , for example , that people whose homes appreciated 1 - 5 \% in value were four times more likely to default than those whose homes appreciated over 10 \% . In other words , home prices did n\'t need to actually fall for problems to develop . ( Of course , home prices fell a lot . ) When Lippmann mentioned this to a Deutsche Bank colleague , he was called a Chicken Little . To which , Lippmann retorted , `` I \'m short your house ! \'\' He did this by buying credit default swaps on the BBB-rated tranches ( slices ) of subprime mortgage bonds .

Here \'s a bit more : Did you know that a pool of mortgages , each with a 615 FICO score , performs very differently ( and better ) than a pool of mortgages with half of the loans with a 550 FICO score and half with a 680 FICO score ( for a 615 average ) ? If you think about it , the 550/680 pool is apt to perform significantly worse , because more of the 550 FICO score loans develop problems . Think about how that got gamed . There \'s more , but hopefully you \'ve gotten the point . This is a very interesting , entertaining and informative book that accomplishes what it sets out to do . Chances are you \'ll enjoy it .

No , not really - especially when there is so much maudlin dialog spread throughout this film . I have to give credit to the marketing people and the producers .

The romantic mythology of this age group is a very powerful thing and this film carefully harnesses that energy , generating massive ticket sales . But is the film deserving of such attention ? No , its not well made , the acting is boring and bad and the movie is unintentially funny . Lets hope this fad dies a quick death . ',ironisch

779,40_10_RK2HL773C5MAF.txt,' In this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of 1988 , Toni Morrison frees herself from the bonds of traditional narrative and establishes an independent style , just as her characters have freed themselves from the horrors of slavery and escaped from Kentucky to Ohio . Revealing the story of Sethe and her family as they survive the brutality of the farm , only to encounter torments even more punishing than whippings after they escape , Morrison presents scenes in a seemingly random order , each scene revealing some aspect of life for Sethe , her boys , her dead baby Beloved , and the new baby Denver , both in the past and in the present . Moving back and forth , around , and inside out through Sethe \'s recollections , she gradually reveals Sethe \'s story to the reader , its horror increasing as the reader makes the connections which turn disconnected scenes into a powerful and harrowing chronology . As the novel opens , Sethe and Denver have lived in # 124 , a house in Ohio , for eighteen years , refusing to socialize and enjoying no company . When Paul D. Garner , one of the Sweet Home men and a friend of her long-missing husband , arrives on her doorstep and moves in , Sethe slowly reveals her long-buried nightmares , and the two share their stories of the events leading up to their escape . Most haunting to Sethe is the death of her young daughter Beloved , shortly after the escape from the farm , though the reader does not know for many pages the shocking manner of her death . When a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved arrives at # 124 , shortly after Paul D. , Morrison creates mystery and a heart-stoppingly tense atmosphere when Beloved moves in . As Beloved gradually takes over the household and seems to demand and then possess Sethe \'s soul , the sorrow which has burdened Sethe seems close to breaking her . The sadism of some slave-owners , the devices used to torture , and the desperate measures some slaves took to protect themselves and their loved ones come fully alive here , the horrors growing as the reader gradually discovers the real source of Sethe \'s torment . By forcing the reader to make the connections , instead of spelling out details in a traditional narrative , Morrison strengthens the impact of the novel and its brutal revelations . Symbols of water , rain , snow , and ice connect the disparate scenes , and the use of shadows and the ghostly character of Beloved keep the reader on tenterhooks until the action is eventually resolved . A powerful , atmospheric , and shocking novel , Beloved is also a searing indictment of slavery and the damage it has done to the fabric of life , damage that can not be repaired until it is fully recognized through novels such as this . n Mary Whipple ',normal

783,4_11_R3VWSEWKBKV2NU.txt,' Charles Dickens \'s acknowledged masterpiece , Great Expectations , is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time . It depth and breadth are staggering , as it follows its protagonist , Pip , from his early childhood through his later life . During the course of his life , we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions : love , hate , jealousy , hope , sadness , despair , anger , pity , empathy , sympathy -- and on and on . The story is treasured and revered for many reasons . One of its main strengths is its plot : after a somewhat slow introductory section , Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity . The incredibly complex plotline , full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other , but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement , is also full of constant plot twists , which continue up until , literally , the last paragraph . But , of course , as with all of Dickens \'s major works , it is the characters that make the book . Like Shakespeare , Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters , rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story . And what great characters they are : the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip ; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham ; the beautiful and haughty Estella ; the simple and saint-like Joe ; the kind and benevolent Herbert ; the very human convict , Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters . Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded , very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is , human emotions . We identify with Pip as he winds through his life , because we have been there , too -- the disappointments , the surprises , the loves , the anger , the sadness . In whatever way his story may differ from our own , it is still essentially human , as is ours . For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments , Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book . A masterpiece for the ages , which will endure for years yet to come , Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all , for , at its heart , is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not .

I \'m sure you \'ll hate this review , but remember , this is just one person \'s opinion . I was drawn to this series due to all of the press it \'s been receiving lately , and also because I \'m up for a good , escapist vampire novel now and then . I actually bought the whole box set when it came out recently , but am putting my review here ( instead of with the boxed set ) because I did n\'t even get past this first book . The book did not hold my interest at all , and believe me , I tried to like it . I \'ve been attempting to figure out what the problem is . It \'s not the setting ; I was born in Louisiana , so the setting was one of the attractions of the book . It \'s not the overall , view-from-30,000-feet story ; that was fine . So what was it ? I \'d have to say it was more structural than anything else , for lack of a better word . I found Ms. Harris \' writing to be on par with what an average ninth grader might produce . The characters , even the main ones , were a bit on the superficial side and were n\'t really fully developed . The plot details were quite boring , not engaging at all . The love scenes were a bit cringe-worthy , reminiscent of scenes from poorly executed smut novels ( i.e . just as with smut novels , these parts struck me as nothing more than a fantasy on the part of the author ) .

And I actually liked that the soundtrack was n\'t the typical heavy metal . The story is a little hard to follow , but you can seriously skip the cut scenes and still have an amazing experience . Now , I heard some negative things about this game before I bought it . The biggest one is that the Xbox version is far superior , allegedly . While I ca n\'t compare the two , I can honestly say I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the game . Yes , it has frequent load times . But , you know what ? There \'s so much happening on the screen sometimes , I did n\'t mind the break . The graphics seemed a little low-res , but the inventive style more than made up for it . I will say , though , that if there is a sequel , I hope the PS3 port gets the development attention it deserves . A couple other things to consider : You can beat the game on easy in 8 or 9 hours ( the difficulty is set so easy means normal and normal means you \'ll throw your controller a lot ) . If you want tons of play time for your money , you may want to rent this instead . Also , I \'m aware some people are saying that the game is offensive .

787,39_9_R21ODR3RUTDCQ.txt,' This machine is yet another good example of high quality Hitachi engineering . This compressor has outlasted several other brands . The machine has run two finishing guns continuously for almost a year and has n\'t needed anything more than an oil change The regulator is predictable , and adjusts as easily as other brands . I firmly believe that Hitachi gets 4.1 CFM out of 14.5 amps . We simply do not run out of air no matter how fast we are working with the Senco SFN40 \'s . Down time has been zilch . One thing we did add was a water/oil separator and filter to protect our work and our guns . I suppose Hitachi ( and most other brands ) leaves these off so that they will have a competitive price . But it does not make economical sense for YOU to leave them off . While I have given this compressor a 5 star rating , there are some things for the engineers ( and you ! ) to think about in the next model : 1 . The way the regulator is mounted it is difficult to make a manifold for two hoses without hanging those pipes out there where they can get knocked off . Anyone who has knocked one off before will know that A ) everyone in the neighborhood knows it right away and B ) it puts you down for some expensive time . And C ) when this happens , it often creates an unwanted projectile . It took me three street elbows and an hour of figuring to get the quick disconnects in a safe place . 2 . When you pick the unit up with the handle , the unit tilts a bit . This means you have to hold it out away from your body a bit more than the size of the compressor would promise . All that horsepower weighs enough to make this more uncomfortable than need be . We just bent the handle with a torch to get on the center of gravity . These are relatively small gigs on a really great compressor . I only spent so many words on them so that the engineers might just read this .

789,6_6_R3LH9B6CJLGOG.txt,' the ipod touch 3rd generation is definitely the best multi-functional music player in the market . I got the first gen. 16GB ipod touch when it first came out 2 years ago but I ran out of space but I decided to skip the 2nd gen. because ipods are expensive so I got the 32GB 3rd gen. when it came out . But if you already have the 2nd gen. ipod touch you should save yourself the money and wait for the 4th . when hopefully a camera and a built-in mic would be standard features because this is not such a major update besides a faster processor , new stock headphones , and lower prices . However , this ONLY applies to the 32GB and 64GB versions as others have noted . The 3rd gen. 8GB version is exactly the same as the 2nd gen. except it is repackaged so even with the reduced price , the 8GB is an inferior deal . The first thing I noticed was how much the price of the ipod touch has dropped since its debut . The 16GB was $ 399 when it first came out and now this 32GB is only $ 299 ( $ 279 on amazon ) . This does makes sense because that is how the market works but this is a very good deal . Obviously $ 300 is not money to be thrown around , but the ipod touch is well-rounded and offers many features other than just being a decent music player . I personally could not tell any difference in sound quality from my 1st gen. and my 3rd gen. touch , which is a major disappointment because the basic function of an ipod is a music player and improvements are always welcome if not necessary . The 3rd gen. offers really shoddy and quiet internal speakers , which is better than nothing on the 1st gen. and the stock Apple headphones are just terrible . Note that the 32GB and 64GB versions come with headphones that have a built-in mic and music player controls , but they are basically the same . So you should factor in the cost of buying new headphones . Some respectable brands for headphones or earbuds are Klipsch , Shure and Bose . I personally use Bose overear headphones because the noise that they block off really makes a difference on the crowded subway . While looking for headphones keep in mind that like all things out there , price and quality ( and warrenties ) have a direct correlation . But really , the ipod touch sound quality is not bad at all as much as I bash it . What makes me give 5 stars to this 3rd gen. ipod touch is the fact that its overall package is unmatched in the market today , even with the new Zune HD ( the Zune has a much inferior internet browser and limited apps ) . I am not going to make a comparison between them because both music players attract different audiences , where ipod touch users prefer the apps and the interface while zune users find the Zune Marketplace to be much better than itunes ( Marketplace prices for music are cheaper and are a better value especially for heavy downloaders ) . But for the casual music listener , both are the very similar in form , function , and price . The 3rd gen. ipod touch has a terrific internet browser that is superior to the Blackberry , but its limitations are that it requires a wifi connection and it does not support adobe flash . I use it to jot down notes quickly , to view my documents on my subway to study , check my mail , look up something quickly on the internet , and obviously to listen to music . There is a plethora of apps that can be downloaded and many are free and quite useful like AIM and SportsTap , and Remote . Apple advertises the ipod touch for the games that it can play and you will not be disappointed if you want to play something on the go . Th 3.5 inch screen is crisp and watching videos is a pleasure . And the ipod touch does look great with clean lines but if you do n\'t want to get the backplate scratched , you must by a case . The screen itself on the other hand is very scratch-resistant . I highly recommend the new 3rd generation ipod touch for those who are looking for something in this price range and want a balanced music player that can also play vidoes , surf the web , and play quick games . In a way , people are also paying for the Apple brand , which is not a bad thing considering you can bring your ipod to the apple store to get it fixed , you can purchase many different accessories , and you can have special compatibility features with other apple products such as with macbooks if you already own one or your school/business uses them .

My wife and I are authors and primarily use this for word processing , but also use it for in-bed media ( Hulu/Netflix ) and gaming ( old school games with minimal requirements ) . The keyboard size was an initial concern for us , because we never fully adapted to the really small keys of our previous netbook , but upon receiving the unit , we had no problems adapting to the keys in any way . The screen is very bright by default and we have not had the glare or underlit problems we have had on other screens . We have successfully used the HDMI connector on several different TVs without any issues . The speakers can get decent volume , but the quality is n\'t too great . Most of our media runs just fine . Flash Player 10.1 is supposed to increase the speed of video playback of certain types , but we did n\'t experience a significant gain , but it could be user error/browser choice/etc . Netflix runs just fine and Hulu runs perfectly in its normal size , but full screen it chugs . I \'m not thrilled with the power adapter plugging into the left side of the machine ( prefer it in the back ) , but with the long battery life with minimal performance degradation , I just leave it out , even if a plug is nearby . My wife , however , is just fine with its placement , mostly the aesthetics of having the sleek back .

1186,13_5_R1XI1OO5IWP91U.txt,' * * * * * Geneen Roth hits a home run with her latest book about overeating and so much more in `` Women Food and God \'\' . The theme of the book is that the way we eat , the way we think about food and handle ourselves around it is the way we do everything . The author then shows us how and why this is the case . She describes the food retreats she runs and the women who attend them , and as a reader you will surely identify in some way with every single person -- and with the lesson she illustrates from their lives . This is a more complex book than her earlier books because of the spiritual dimension ; she sees problems with overeating as gateways to spiritual enlightenment . She convinced me ( and will convince you as well ) that instead of trying to get rid of or fix our eating problems , we need to use them to see within ourselves , to learn important spiritual life lessons from our feelings , and to grow and heal so that we will end up eating as a spiritual practice . And so that we \'ll have a permanent end to the misery of always struggling with our weight and self-image , and always striving to improve our relationship with food . The book is so good that for me , just reading it was like a spiritual awakening in this area of my life . I found it motivational , inspirational , and scary in a good way -- and the author makes the whole process doable with descriptions of practices that can be used on the food healing/awakening journey such as meditation , inquiry , and eating guidelines . These practices are all specific to the process and they are described in detail . This spiritual dimension is generic and does not require a particular religious belief , or even any religious belief . It would be compatible with any type of spirituality . The type of eating practiced is intuitive eating ( listening to your body to discern what it wants ) , and no matter what your way of eating , you can apply an intuitive approach to it -- this book is about a way of living and relating to food , not about a food plan . If you have read the author \'s other books ( as I have ) you will find much new information here . Other key themes of the book include mindfulness , presence , and feeling your feelings . The author is brutal but honest in describing how destructive the dieting industry is to women . Again , this is definitely not a diet book or eating plan , but instead a way of experiencing life which allows you to be present and aware so that you are able to listen to your body and choose food based on nourishment and self-care . Although it is a quick read ( I read it in one evening ) , this book is so valuable that you will want to refer back to it , highlight it for future reference , take notes in the margins , and use parts for journal prompts . There is only one negative , and it is a biggy : the paper in this hardback book is similar to super cheap mass market paperback-type paper . I have never seen an actual book of any type with such paper , though ! I tried to highlight sections and the highlighter not only would bleed through to the reverse side of the page , but sometimes onto the previous page ! It is hard to describe how frustrating this was -- -a book that is a true keeper on throw-away paper . I highlighted anyway and my book is a mess , but I decided to rebuy it on Kindle when it comes out . I \'ve never done this before , but it \'s that good of a book -- worth months ( or maybe years ) of therapy . I also would buy it again if it is reprinted ( and I \'ll bet it will be ) with a paper that matches the quality of the book . That flaw aside , I \'m so glad I bought this book . I have read many , many books on overeating , diet and nutrition , self-help , styles of eating , and more , and this book stands apart from the crowd . The message is an important one for any woman who wants to handle her relationship with food , her weight , and her spirituality in a healthy way , and to become whole . If that is you , you will not be disappointed , I promise . Highest recommendation . * * * * * ',normal

1192,20_7_R3B5G02I1XM5WU.txt,' First of all , I HATE 3rd person games where shooting is involved . Someone talked me into getting this game . I should have known better . You get ONE walk through on how to do a duel . I have no idea how the heck I made it through the first one . Another thing I hate is games with a lot of cut scenes . Oh my God but you have to wait a friggin \' hour before this game finally gets through all of its opening cut scenes and lets you finally play the game . ( I exagerate here only slightly ) Fast forward to tonight . I played the game for two hours . I go through cut scene hell , pushing cows ( lots of excitement in that ) , roping horses , and figuring out how to stay on them to break them . It says `` stay centered \'\' but the screen jumps around so much you ca n\'t figure out what is centered . I finally get through all of that and take my new horse to town . Now , when you first load the game , it tells you it has an auto save and gives you the option to turn it off . So , of course , I left the auto save on . Rockstar \'s definition of autosave is apparently not the same as mine . After getting my new horse to town , I run into a guy who wants to duel . OK . I saw that it gave me a walk through last time , I \'ll get one this time just like you do with poker , right ? Wrong . Nothing . I hit one button and I \'m dead . Guess what else ? No friggin \' auto save . I \'m right back to where I was 2 hours ago . I will have to go through all that stupid cow herding and horse breaking again , with all of its associated and asinine cut scenes . I snatched the game out of the xbox , put it back on the shelf , and it will likely stay there for quite some time . This game sucks . Period . Edit : I found a how to dueling thread on [ apparently , Amazon wo n\'t let you post a link , but it is on reddeadDOTnet -- see the comments for the actual link ] for those who are going to buy this game anyway and those who already have it that may be as frustrated with the lack of instructions as I am . It helped me figure out the dueling system . Whatever you do , do n\'t ask for help there without searching the threads or the fanboys will be on you faster than they are here on Amazon . Second Edit : I am forcing myself to finish this game . This space will catalogue the various glitches , bugs , and annoyances that I find with the game as I go along . Will these get fixed in a patch ? I hope so , but I doubt it . 1 . Despite what is claimed in the comments to my review , not every cut scene can be skipped . The larger ones can be skipped by pressing `` a \'\' . However , the more constant and smaller cut scenes such as looting , skinning and picking flowers/herbs can not be skipped by pressing `` a \'\' . What I have found , at least with skinning is that if you stop your horse just to the right of the animal and dismount on top of it , it will SOMETIMES skip the cut scene . 2 . Broken camera angles . This is the major failure of ALL third person shooters . In this particular game , it means that in a confined space ( in a building , mine , or some such area ) you can be looking at whatever it is you want to shoot and have the dot on the target , but when you pull the trigger the round hits whatever object you are standing next to . This can get you killed in a hurry because while you ca n\'t hit the target , the target CAN hit you . 3 . The instructions , both in-game and the manual , are pathetic . As some of the fanboys have said ( with a perverse sense of pride that I can not fathom ) , the game leaves you figuring out a lot of its controls through trial and error . Error in this game means you die and go back to your last saved area . Sometimes this means completely across the map . That \'s a heckuva price to pay for trial and error . 4 . Senseless mission fails . There are ways to fail missions that make no sense and can not be avoided unless you know about them . In the first horse roping mission , for example , if you get too far away from Bonnie , you fail -- even if you are pursuing one of the horses you are supposed to catch . You can fail the barn burning mission by bumping into Bonnie ( you `` assaulted \'\' her ) , or jumping the fence on your horse ( you `` terrorized the townsfolk \'\' ) . 5 . Crashes . After learning my lesson the hard way about autosave ( it has now failed me twice ) , I am living by the mantra , `` save early , save often \'\' . After completing the main story line mission that involves assaulting a fort , I immediately ran from the fort ( because the game will not let you camp/save in a town , on a road , near water , on slanted ground , or any hideout ) , got to an open area , hit my improved campfire and the game froze . Hard lock . I had to reboot the xbox . And guess what ? I had to do the entire mission again . I think this technically counts as the third failure of autosave because it did not save the game after completing the mission . 6 . Following the chatty NPC . Many of the mainline missions require you to either walk with the NPC or go on a ride with him while he talks about all kinds of crap . Some of these rides are ridiculously long and involve you just sitting there , holding down `` a \'\' , and correcting the steering every now and again because the autofollow is even less reliable than the autosave . 7 . Teleporting bear packs . Someone needs to give Rockstar \'s programmers a biology lesson . With the exception of mating season , bears - particularly grizzlies - are solitary animals . They do not hunt in packs . There is an open area in Tall Trees where the bears not only hunt in packs of five at a time , but their reinforcements teleport from God knows where to appear right behind you if you try to skin one of their comrades . After getting killed twice by bears appearing out of nowhere , I had the camera angle up high and looking nearly straight down so I could see what was happening . A bear popped out of the ether right behind me and proceeded to maul me before I could do anything . If hunting here , do NOT try to skin a bear until you have killed at least four of them . UPDATE : It appears that I was wrong on my numbers . I shot a bear near Tanners in Tall Trees that started an endless loop of bears . They popped out of thin air in ones and twos , and kept coming until there were no less than 25 bears dead on the ground . In one place , I had four of them piled up dead on top of my dead horse . The spawns came about 2 seconds after the previous wave died . I found that the only way to skin was to wait for one to pop far enough away from the ones you had already killed , leave the live bear alone , and try to skin before he noticed you ( using the no cut scene trick helps ) . They kept coming until a random encounter popped up in the middle of it . They stopped right after that . I also hit this same loop further down the road from Tanners in an open area across the trail from the area where Jack goes to hunt bear . I died before they stopped coming because the random encounter that popped in the middle of that one involved a bunch of guys shooting at me while I was trying to fend off two bears . 8 . Inexplicable horse deaths . Another skinning issue I guess . I got off my horse to skin a deer on the edge of a messa . There was nothing in the area except me , the horse , and the dearly departed deer . As the skinning cut scene started , the horse whinnied and fell stone dead , passing right through me as it did so . I guess it could n\'t stand the sight of blood . 9 . Aiming . The LT locking feature is about the only way to get through this game , but its got some serious problems . As an example , I had a bear coming at me . I pull LT . Guess what our hero , John does ? Aim at the bear you say ? Wrong , says I . He points his gun straight up in the air and aims at some harmless passing bird . I had to hit dead eye quickly , bring the aim down manually , and dispatch the bear before I got turned into lunch . That \'s not the only aiming problem . Get a gun with a scope . Pull LT. You can have a target dead center on the screen and the scope aims at the ground a few yards in front of you . This bit of stupidity makes using scoped weapons all but useless in combat . About the only place you can use it and hope to survive is the first couple of shots in a long range battle . 10 . The ending . Lame . Completely and totally horrid . I do n\'t want to post a spoiler , but they have Marston do the most asinine thing I have ever seen in a video game . I mean , really . Good grief . You guys could n\'t think of a better ending ? Oh , and if you do play this game through to completion and want to keep playing it , make sure you let the ENTIRE credits roll . 11 . The 100 \% completion achievement . I \'m sitting at 95.5 \% . Guess what the .5 \% is ? Bounty missions . You have to successfully complete a bounty at every bounty location on the map . The problem ? The assignment of a bounty area is completely random . I \'ve been trying all day to get the last three I need in Mexico , and all I am getting are the same sites over and over again . 3 more missions and I can trade this stupid game in . FINAL NOTES . I \'m still trying to get those last 3 bounty missions so I can get the 100 \% completion achievement . While it is entirely possible , I do not believe I \'m going to see anything new that warrants editing this review again . Having completed 95.5 \% of the game , I can make my final observations . I will plagarize the first one . RENT this game before you buy it -- particularly if you do n\'t ordinarily like 3rd person shooters . Do n\'t buy the hype , this game is not that great in my opinion . If you rent it , and you conclude that I \'m wrong , you can always go buy it . If , however , you agree with my opinion , you have saved yourself about $ 50 , and the time I will have spent doing battle with the fanboys will have been worth it . Second , to say something nice about the game , the graphics for the world are outstanding . This could have been a great world to play in . Kudos to the people who designed the sandbox . Third , the game still sucks . Maybe not `` period \'\' ( because of the gorgeous sandbox ) , but it still sucks for all of the reasons I listed above . A pathetic 1 out of 5 stars . OK , ONE MORE FINAL EDIT . I am now at 99.7 \% completion and have been for a week . I need three more bounty missions in Mexico . The way it works , the name of the bounty does n\'t matter , it is the location where he is holed up . You have to get all the LOCATIONS . The problem ? It keeps spawning the SAME THREE MISSION LOCATIONS . It has done this for a solid WEEK of real time . It will not give me anything but three of the same locations over and over again . It does n\'t matter how I complete the missions it gives me ( kill or capture ) . It does not matter where I get the missions from ( there are three locations in Mexico to pick up bounty missions and I \'ve done all three ) . This achievement is COMPLETELY BROKEN because the game is stuck in an endless loop of the same three bounty locations . I really wish I could give this game a zero . ',ironisch
800,40_8_R1JVBMSJ98GPS7.txt,' I have used every Microsoft OS since DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1 . Until now my favorite was Windows 2000 . XP was pretty solid ( after service pack 2 ) except for all of the security holes . Every time I would need to fix an XP machine it was n\'t because of something wrong with the OS itself , but because the machine had virus/spyware/trojans etc . Enter Vista . MS fixed most of the security problems but did so at the expense of performance and stability . Now with Windows 7 you get the best of both worlds . XP was released in 2001 and hardware has come a long way since then , but the OS itself remained relatively static and could only take advantage of newer hardware at a basic level . Vista was an improvement and Windows 7 handles it better still . I think Vista , although I had few problems with it , will go down as ME 2.0 . At the same time Windows 7 will be XP 2.0 . People will cling to it and MS will have to kill it off before people will move on to it \'s next offering , whatever that may be . With that said I would highly recommend that both XP and Vista users upgrade . Unlike previous upgrades you will actually get better performance and use less resources post-upgrade . A first for MS. Security is rock solid . If XP is swiss cheese , then Win 7 is the wall of China . You no longer have to download the `` patch of the day \'\' from Windows Update . I have n\'t played around with Media Player , but Media Center is great for watching DVDs and remains pretty much unchanged from Vista . My favorite features are Jump Lists , AERO Snap ( for working in two windows side by side ) . Networking is a bit easier ( especially compared to XP ) . Performance is much improved from Vista and is comparable to or even faster than XP . Calculator , Paint , and Wordpad have been updated . If you are upgrading from Vista you do lose a couple of progams , namely Windows Mail and Photo Gallery . Updated versions can be downloaded from Windows Update for free . The only downside is that upgrading from XP requires a clean install . As far as the upgrade process itself goes , it \'s painless . Just be sure to run the upgrade advisor before you do . All that \'s required of you is a product key ( at the end of the installation ) and activation . So all you have to do is pop the disc in , grab a good book , and before you know it you \'re in computing heaven . ',normal

806,45_1_R34H10JAG0HI81.txt,' If Tori Spelling ever had anything remotely interesting on her mind ( which is debatable ) , she has now officially run out of thoughts . Her third book `` Uncharted TerriTORI \'\' is an exercise in vapidity , in which Spelling disingenuously rambles on about the exact same subjects that her previous books were about -- and honestly , she usually comes across as a spoiled brat playing at being a grown-up . A lot of her essays are on pretty mundane events -- meeting her hubby \'s understandably bitter ex-wife , the woes of motherhood , family vacations , stress , clinginess towards friends , jury duty , meeting her grandparents , her son \'s first day at school , swine flu , and so on . In the hands of a more self-aware person this would n\'t be a problem , but Spelling acts as if she is literally the first person to ever experience these things . And she rambles about far less mundane things : what meanies the 90210 cast are ( according to her , she was the `` sweet \'\' one and they should just LOVE her ) , sex in a hospital bed , overcoming the paparazzi , starring in a reality show , the terrors of staying at a cheap motel , and adopting a pig . Plus , she tries to overcome her aviatophobia by going to a psychic AND a past-life specialist , and tries to cure headaches with voodoo BEFORE consulting a doctor . Only in L.A. , people . `` Uncharted TerriTORI \'\' is basically a big puff pastry , filled with air and flakes -- and reading it is a lot like listening to someone nattering about the minutiae of their uninteresting life . Tori Spelling seems to have two modes of thought : either she is desperately trying to convince us that she \'s `` just people \'\' or she \'s dissecting mundane events and blowing them WILDLY out of proportion . So unsurprisingly , a lot of `` Uncharted TerriTORI \'\' is painfully boring , as Spelling either does boring stuff or contemplates her own surgically-enhanced navel . The entire book is written in a coyly disingenuous style , with all the boring stuff only broken by moments of unintentionally hilarious melodrama -- just look at the scene where Spelling \'s husband rips out her IV and carries her ( soap opera style ) through the hospital , yelling for doctors . Who can take that seriously ? Spelling herself does n\'t come across too well -- she seems pampered , clingy , whiny , and laughably entitled ( `` Maybe I was born into wealth as punishment for my behavior asn an Egyptian pharoah \'\' ) . Additionally , her obsession with herself ( a whole chapter on TWEETING ! ) is just painful . And though she spends a LOT of time trying to convince us that her marriage is not `` loveless \'\' as the tabloids say , her husband comes across as a manipulative creep who is just tolerating her . `` Uncharted TerriTORI \'\' is an exercise in tedium , similar to dragging yourself across a very long bed of nails -- boring , painful and seemingly never over .

Bella is given a birthday party and accidentally gets a paper cut . This leads to a tense moment when one of the family members can not contain themselves and makes a leap for Bella . Edward is forced to protect her , but this makes it all to clear that keeping Bella close to the family puts her at risk . Edward begins to withdraw himself emotionally in order to ( we readers know what is going to happen , but Bella seems to be in denial ) leave her . Naturally , Bella \'s grief is heartwrenching to read . Any girl who has felt the pain of lost or unrequited love will shed a few tears during this chapter . It is hard to get over being furious at Edward \'s behavior at the begining of the book , but this simply shows you how easy it is to get pulled into almost believing these characters are real . Bella becomes seriously withdrawn from the world after his departure and considering their strange and magical relationship , this is to be expected . I do miss Edward \'s presence-he was such a strong character in Twilight- but I did something I never do , I flipped to the back of the book to assure myself of his return . Ms. Meyer realizes how addicted her audience is to Edward , so he does make token appearances in a roundabout way . Bella begins to hear Edward \'s voice warning her when she puts herself in harm \'s way and in this way Bella begins to court danger . Jacob , the young native American from Twilight , makes a reappearance in New Moon . He becomes a very close friend of Bella \'s and helps her through her depression . His character takes the place of Edward and he becomes a major player in this story . He is also the complete opposite of Edward \'s sophisticated , wordly one . Jacob is lovable , akward , attractive ( in a regular way ) and warm-blooded . His story is one of interest and I do n\'t believe any reader who has already read Twilight , will be surprised at the turn of events in which Jacob is involved . The book is certainly excellent , as Ms. Meyer is a fabulous writer , but I do find myself impatiently turning the pages and skimming ahead to see when one of the Cullens \' family members will appear . Even with those minor faults , I still find myself staying up way too late to finish another chapter . I have read half the book in the past two days instead of working on lesson plans for my class , during the first week of school , no less . This is a real indicator of just how wonderful New Moon is . My ultimate disappointment will be when I am finished and must wait another year for the next book to come out . I do n\'t believe Stephenie Meyer can whip these out fast enough to appease her growing leagues of fans . This is a very desirable position to be in for a writer and this should guarantee many Bella and Edward stories in the future . * Update The ending was very good and the reader finds out some interesting information concerning Bella and how special she really is . The twist adds a new dimension to the novel it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger . There is no complete closure for a few important issues and obviously this leaves it wide open for the third novel in the series . ',normal
1042,51_5_R3V2K3R4BCRJ75.txt,' My son talked me into reading these books with him , and we loved them . When we went to see the new Harry Potter movie , scenes for it came on during the trailers . He recognized the story the second the preview started . He was thrilled , and so was I . What potential this unique and fun series had for a movie -- or movies ... I mean , they advertised that it was being brought to us by the people who make the Harry Potter movies . The Potter movies stay so true to the book -- taking care to absolutely keep things in the screenplay that are necessary to the plot line . I wish I could say the same for this movie . When it finally came out , we went to a movie theater in NJ that was right across the river from NYC . We could see the Empire State building from the theater parking lot , and took it as a sign that the movie was going to rock . We were so psyched to see it . When we left the theater , I thought my son was going to cry , and I could n\'t un-scrunch my eyebrows -- huh ? ? I felt so bad for him , for me , for Rick Riordan ... We understand that it \'s impossible to make a movie exactly like a book -- but this was a travesty . Every important aspect of the story was by-passed for the sake of special effects . It \'s almost as if the screenwriter had been given a verbal summary of what the book was about , and took it from there . So many important plot points were left out or down right changed to the point that it would be impossible to even think about a sequel . It \'s such a shame . These stories have the `` book made to movie \'\' potential of the Potter series , or dare I say , a kids `` Lord of the Rings \'\' . If someone with vision had just read the books , the money used to make it could have been so much better spent . It could have been knocked out of the park , but , alas , the ball was dropped and we all lost . ',ironisch

820,40_17_R1YJHP9N0QZ1IG.txt,' I found this movie to be an incredibly stupid incoherent mess of scenes and CGI . I did n\'t get anything out of this movie except a couple laughs . My main problem is how unrealistic this movie is . In the first place you have Susie Salmon played by Saoirse Ronan who is a gullible girl in whom it \'s obvious her parents did n\'t teach her anything because she stupidly follows the neighborhood pedophile played by Stanley Tucci into some makeshift underground room/pedo-shrine where she gets raped and murdered by the psycho . Then it becomes even more disturbing when her soul gets transported to her very own cheesy CGI version of pergatory where she is able to go sledding on top of fake CG snowy mountains , dance like a hippy in front of a fake CG city ( I cringed at that part ) and she even becomes friends with a random victim of the same pedophile on the other side she then shoots the @ # $ # with . This movie has a disturbing undertone and sends the wrong message that she is better off being raped and killed just so long as when it \'s all said and done she can be transported to her own little wonderland of fun . The movie then wants you to think that she can help her parents solve her murder but it becomes a useless plot line and nothing really becomes of it . Jack Salmon who is the father of Susie Salmon ( played by Mark Wahlberg ) basically transforms into a paranoid wreck because of the murder to the point of wanting the police to randomly investigate hundreds of people/neighbors on suspicion of murder without one single shred of proof . As if this was n\'t laughable enough , Susie Salmon \'s little sister Lindsey Salmon is walking her dog after the murder and when she stops in front of the pedophile \'s house the dog begins to bark at it and this is apparently all the proof the Salmon family needs to know that the he \'s the guy that is responsible for the murder ( lol ) . At this point the movie becomes ridiculous when Jack Salmon tails the pedophile with a baseball bat into a corn field for some revenge only to stumble onto a pair of high school lovers which results in Jack Salmon getting his ass kicked by a jock with his own bat no less which earns him a trip to the hospital . I can go on and on but I \'ll end this review by saying the movie reaches it \'s conclusion with the murder being unsolved ; the presumption that it \'s okay to break into a person \'s house to obtain evidence ; Susie Salmon ridiculously manifesting herself into the body of another girl order to obtain a kiss from a five minute crush whom she met at the start of the movie ; a random miniature icicle brings ultimate justice when it falls on the pedophile with the force of a soft teddy bear causing him thus to fall off a cliff ( lol ) . Thank heaven this was only a $ 1 rental . Since this movie is asinine to the tenth degree treat it like the plague and run , you \'ll be doing you and your family a favor . I \'d imagine only a narcotics addict would find this movie remotely interesting . ',ironisch

823,45_13_R2ZKKPC9XS0D61.txt,' * updated review at bottom * original review : So I bought this phone via sprint when it came out , should \'ve waited for amazon , would \'ve saved me about 75 dollars . ANYHOO ! I love this phone ! Pros : -All the apps , music capabilities , etc that the iphone has -Decent sound quality ( I hear everyone crystal clear ) -Touchscreen everything but you can use the optical mouse and slide out keyboard ( which I love ) -Extremely intuitive . I only had to refer to the manual once so far ( had it about a week now ) and that was to take the battery cover off ( which I never ended up getting to in the book because I slid it off ) . -Decent battery life -regular headphones work with it Cons : - it \'s supposed to be 5.5 hours of talk time , but if you talk on it for 2 hours straight while playing games online ( on the phone ) , it tends to be a bit shorter ! So battery life took a star . Also regular usage gets it only 9 or 10 hours before you want to charge to be on the safe side . - If you put a pattern lock ( have to draw a specific design/connect dots ) on the phone to prevent it from doing things by accident via touch screen , it has a one-touch EMERGENCY DIAL button always present when you unlock the phone to use it . Which routes directly to your county 911 . And if you realize it too late and hang up quickly the 911 operator calls you back to make sure you \'re ok . Which is a good idea but horrible if you \'re half asleep and grab the phone to check a text message . I \'ll update if I find anything new awesome and or horribly bad with it . But it \'s perfect for me . So I definately recommend . * * update November 27 , 2009 * * So I \'ve had this phone almost a month now and still in love with it . I did have a problem with the speaker phone not working ( I could hear everyone crystal clear , but I was fading in and out even if I was not moving in a silent room with no background noise . Yes , I made someone help me test this before I officially concluded it WAS my phone afterall ) . I took it back to the Sprint Store I got it from ( a few blocks from me ) and they replaced it that day no charge at all ( it has a 30 day unlimited warranty . This was about a week after I got the phone ) . I \'ve come to terms with the battery life issue after consulting with someone who has a g1 and has the same low battery problems . So it lasts me about 5-8 hours a day ( usually tons of texting involved and applications being played ) before it gives me the low battery ( 15 \% remaining ) warning . Then I come home and stick it on the charger or just let it be until I know I can dedicate 3-4 hours to charging this baby up . ( It did however last me from 1pm yesterday afternoon to 8am this morning with moderate texting and phone usage only before dying . Was able to make a phone call immediately once it was attached to the charger though ) . I still believe is the perfect phone for me of all out there on the market ( and yes , I played with the Droid but hate the keyboard ) . It is sluggish to touch sometimes , double tapping the screen to `` wake it up \'\' during a phone call can inadvertantly lead to hanging up sometimes , and when you \'re typing very fast it does n\'t always imput it right away or will get backed up on a few letters . I \'ve been using it as an mp3 player and hooking it to my car speakers while driving . It can charge AND play music at the same time . Some applications and games ARE more draining then others though , but you can generally figure out which ones . It \'s still , in my opionion , an all around wonderful phone . * * * UPDATE * JULY 15 , 2010 * * * * So still have the same actual phone as I did last time update , it \'s gone through 2 sprint updates needed to be done in store . So some changes to original review needed ! The updates have fixed the issues of super short battery life ( extremely high android/internet usage for a 16 hour period before needing a charge and otherwise normal usage ( frequent but not high texting , somewhat high internet usage ) will last the day ( 8am to 3am , so 29 hours roughly ) . Updates also fixed ( apparently ) the speakerphone issue and the mute button issue and the issue of hanging up accidently while trying to wake screen up during phone call . The android has been updated to 2.2 ( or 2.1 , double check on that . HAS BEEN UPDATED TO ONE OF THOSE THOUGH ! ) . Touch screen occasionally will be taken over by ghosts ( not really often , but enough to be mentioned ) , but I think that has more to do with the screen covers I put on there . The camera and video features now have zoom ! Not a very BIG zoom , but a zoom nonetheless . Still love the phone , still recommend ! : - ) ',normal

I originally planned to use it as a second game system but there are few originals while the XBOX has tons of exclusives not availble for PS3 ( Halo , Gears of War , Forza , Mass Effect etc ) . But the biggest drawback for me personally is that the PS3 controller is the same size and design as the one introduced 15 years ago on the original Playstation . Sure , its wireless now but its too small and not ergonomic ( unless you are a child or chimpanzee ) . The new slimline is slightly nicer than the old toaster but it is still not stackable due to its curved case . For some reason Sony thinks the Playstation needs to handle well in wind tunnels . The `` sleek \'\' design may come in handy when I toss it out the window to replace with a normal Bluray player .

Given the quirkiness of the screen , it ends up being more like : 1 ) tap menu , 2 ) tap back because it took you to the wrong place , 3 ) tap menu again , 4 ) tap volume , 5 ) tap volume again because it did n\'t respond , 6 ) tap back because it went into settings instead of volume , 7 ) tap `` No I do n\'t want to erase everything \'\' because it tapped some mystical `` Destructo \'\' button somewhere in a Settings menu that you never meant to navigate to , 8 ) ...

829,1_3_R33ZA4OFBTBDTS.txt,' For me , this is an incredibly difficult movie to review and critique . I feel that the movie did a phenomenal job of developing the story ; however , the acting in the movie left something to be desired . In case someone has not seen the movie , I do not want to give much of the story away . An asteroid , classified as a global killer ( a global killer meaning that if it impacts earth , there will be total destruction of life ) , is on a collision course with earth . NASA comes up with the idea of landing on the asteroid , drilling a hole , and dropping a nuclear weapon in the hole and blowing up the asteroid with the intent of splitting it in two and altering its path so it misses earth . While it is a simple story , the movie does an exceptional job developing the plot into a 2-hour movie . The movie incorporates a `` gloom and doom \'\' plot with a second story of love , romance , and hope . The first plot is about an oil driller and his band of misfits attempting to work with a group of highly educated astronauts and military pilots to drill a hole on the asteroid ( and of course the work together as well as Worcestershire sauce and ice cream ) . The second story line involves one of the oil drillers falling in love with the owners daughter . The relationship reminds me of a terrible `` teen-age \'\' relationship with the seemingly perfect love that young people share coupled with a resentful father who seems to not want to lose his daughter . It is difficult to explain how well the two story lines integrate without ruining the movie for someone who has not seen it . While the plot is superb , the acting in the move is just so-so . I thought the acting of the three headline actors ( Bruce Willis , Ben Affleck , and Liv Tyler ) was weak at best ; they had their great moments , but mostly their acting seemed almost emotionless . I did think a couple of the lesser known actors ( mainly Michael Clarke Duncan as `` Bear \'\' and Peter Stormare as the Russian astronaut ) were incredible in this movie . Personally , due to the overwhelming depressing plot about the end of the earth , I do n\'t think this is a movie I would cuddle with on the couch with a new date . However , I nonetheless think the plot is excellent and I do highly recommend seeing this movie . I give the movie 5 stars for how the movie integrates the two story lines together and develops them into a great plot , not the acting in the movie . ',normal

His old watch had fallen apart due to physical beatings ( the face was cracked ) exposed to the elements ( at the time he was stationed in Arizona ) and the band was cracking . I did research and came across the G-Shock . I read reviews for different models all over the internet and saw a lot of military personnel ( both active and retired ) give this watch rave reviews . It had the perfect amount of features ( not too much , not too little ) and was n\'t flashy and followed his dress code for when he wears his Dress Blues and is lighter than it looks . My brother got it for Xmas 08 and he has no complaints whatsoever . This watch has been subjected to the same abuse as the other ( even more now that he is stationed in Afghanistan ) and still looks new .

837,37_5_R3M62HO4M6LXE6.txt,' Wow . I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked . Suzanne Collins narrative here has an immediacy to it that , when combined with the very dramatic life-or-death plot , is incredibly compelling . It \'s entertaining , and incredibly disturbing all at once . If this was merely a good read , I would have given it 4 stars , but they say great art leaves you changed after you experience it ... and this book definitely did that . Suzanne Collins has , with one amazing work , propelled herself onto my top shelf . Parents , caveat emptor ! The storyline is brutal . Even though the writing is geared for young adults , the main characters are teenagers , there \'s very little physical romance , and the actual violence would probably count as PG-13 nowadays ... it \'s probably one of the most terrifying books I \'ve read in a very long time ! Right up there with George R.R . Martin , if not more so . Remember what we learned from Jaws : you do n\'t actually need to SEE the shark in order for it to be terrifying . Sometimes not seeing the shark is even worse . The story is basically about a teenager who is forced to compete in a 24-man-enter-1-man-leaves event . I do n\'t want to spoil it by saying any more , but if you liked The Running Man , you \'ll definitely like this . And if you \'re young enough that you do n\'t remember The Running Man , nor did you get the Thunderdome reference , then I \'m just way too old .

842,7_12_R1S2TWMUY472V5.txt,' There are two things I take very seriously in this life : one is books , the other is coffee ( not surprisingly , the often go together ) . While the bulk of my reviews are children \'s books , I felt it necessary to go against type and review this coffee grinder . Most coffee experts as well as everyday , casual drinkers agree that the best tasting coffee is brewed with freshly ground beans . Once beans are ground , they begin to oxidize , much like an opened bottle of wine . Old preground coffee has a tendency to taste bitter , and with the proliferation of inexpensive grinders , more and more people are buying whole bean coffee to grind right before they brew . Of course , finding the RIGHT grinder for the price is the tough part . Grinders exist in every form and size and expense bracket . Quite a lot of round , domed grinders I \'ve used have unsharpened blades on a mount that is too high to really grind beans fine enough for specialty coffee like espresso or Turkish . The Krups has a few advantages over other grinders , namely these : * * The blades are sharp and mounted low in the housing . Maybe other manufactures are saving a few pennies by putting flat tongues of metal in their grinders , but they do n\'t have the edge to pulverize beans like the Krups can . * * The machine has a higher RPM than other machines . This makes it easier to reduce grind times and with additional speed , can reduce whole beans to powder in less than a minute ( I \'ve had a Black n \' Decker that could n\'t grind beans for Turkish coffee if you held the button for half an hour ) . * * the housing is oval and the lid is flat . I \'m not an engineer or physicist , but I think the flat lid and oval shape allow the beans to fall back towards the blades for further grinding ( again , my Black n \' Decker allowed the beans to spin around the lid in a whirlpool pattern that was pretty to look at , but pointless for actually reducing the grounds to the small particles I wanted ) . * * it has a large capacity . Do you like strong coffee ? ? Use more grounds , then ! ! The box says that you can grind up to 20 cups of java at a time . I do n\'t know about the sorts of demitasses they must be using to gauge the volume of a & quot ; cup & quot ; , but I do know that this machine can grind up enough beans for a number of very stiff MUGS of coffee . In the disadvantages column , the only one I could site is that the housing cup is slanted down , I \'m assuming for decorative purposes . Hence , I \'m forever spilling beans out of the lower side . My new secret is to measure the beans out in the LID , first , then turn the whole thing upside down and put the housing into the lid . Since I only use it to grind coffee ( and while I drink my fair share , I do n\'t have the thing running nonstop day and night ) , I ca n\'t speak with any aplomb about how sturdy a machine is or how long it lasts . I once dropped one after a year and broke it , but it seemed nowhere near quitting , so I ca n\'t vouch for how long it would work under normal , non-butterfingered conditions . My assumption is that anything with such a high RPM rate is n\'t intended to be kept running for long periods of time -- creates too much heat and friction -- so if you plan to grind coffee night and day , it \'s probably best that you spend the money on a professional model intended for cafes . All in all , a fine piece of workmanship and definitely worth the extra few dollars over many of the other , cheaper , more poorly-designed grinders on the market today . ',normal

The theme is also highly relevant to our times . The expressivity of the actors is beyond comparison , certainly real , and enhanced by the technology used to produce this . I really look forward to an expanded version of this blu-ray in the future , if one is forthcoming . I have heard a popular story line related to the lack of an original story or character development in this , and it is just gibberish . I can see how the film would be viewed as a threat to traditional Hollywood filmmaking , however . I have seen \'Hurt Locker \' that won the Academy Award for best picture , and it is a good film . The single theme and unidimensional character of that movie was simply this : obsession with dangerous work . In contrast , Avatar has a great deal to say about native cultures that are close to nature ( e.g. , stone age cultures ) in general , exploitation of resources by technology-driven societies , and the mystery of life itself . It will make you think about the mystery of incarnation . This is a deeply thoughtful production , a fact that should not be missed as you follow the carefully written action/adventure story line .

846,50_9_R3LSHDZJLETRCK.txt,' Simple Plan \'s second original CD , `` Still Not Getting Any . . . `` gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD . If anything , it is an improvement on the first . Fans at their shows have already been introduced to `` Welcome to My Life \'\' and `` Shut Up ! `` , both good , catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP \'s trademark . `` Shut Up ! \'\' in particular , shows the band \'s knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes , in a song which I interpret as a teenager \'s thoughts while being lectured by his parents . Something \'s changed a bit from the first CD , and that \'s the band \'s perspective . Many of the songs on `` No Pads , No Helmets , . . . Just Balls \'\' had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent . There \'s still a bit of that in songs like `` Me Against The World \'\' and `` Shut Up ! `` , but this time , more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad ( for example , `` Perfect World \'\' , `` Everytime \'\' and `` Thank You \'\' ) , and the perspective is more young adult than teenager -- \'\' Everytime \'\' talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn -- not likely if still living at home . The band \'s characters are maturing , as is their music . Other notable songs include `` Crazy \'\' , a throwback to Reset \'s ( the predecessor band to Simple Plan ) socially-conscious songs , and `` Jump \'\' , plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right . Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is `` Untitled \'\' , a downbeat song with downbeat music , the dying thought of someone who does n\'t know why he \'s dying , and despite the people around him , is dying utterly alone . The sadness which runs through many of the band \'s works is here in full strength . Softer than usual and using a piano ( shades of `` Meet You There \'\' on the first CD ) , even if never released as a single , it may well be the band \'s best song to date . While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD , much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers do a lot more of the singing here , and they are well worth listening to . Extras on the DVD or flip side ( depending on edition ) include the video for `` Welcome to My Life \'\' and the program ( shown , I believe , on MTV ) about its making .

848,48_13_RJUQTGB14673K.txt,' Let me say , I \'ve owned several Sony digital cameras over the years . First a DSC-P50 circa 2001 , then a couple of random ones I purchased new and wound up selling because they had poor picture quality . Then in 2005 I purchased a Sony DSC-W7 ( 7.2 mp ) point-and-shoot . This is a good little camera but the PQ has always been a little hit and miss . I would say I got one or two good shots out of every 100 . Some problems with the W7 were autofocus that did n\'t focus properly ( especially in indoor , low-light conditions ) , redeye was pervasive ( even with the redeye reduction feature turned on ) , and shutter lag time . ( One feature I liked about the W7 was the inclusion of an optical viewfinder , which it seems most of the manufacturers have now abandoned on these small digital cameras . ) Most of these problems seem to be addressed with the newest ( 2010 ) generation of Sony DSC point-and-shoots . I decided this was the time to replace the W7 , and it came down to a choice between a DSC-W330 and DSC-W370 . After taking some test photos in the store , and sending those photos to my personal computer at home for analysis , I decided to purchase the W370 . The W370 does not have an optical viewfinder , but it has everything else , and does everything right . The low-light , indoor shooting that the W7 could not handle is not an issue at all for the W370 . Each indoor shot has been clear and well-focused , with exquisite background detail in shot after shot . In 10 test shots , only 1 came out bad , whereas with previous Sonys there might be 4 good shots and 6 bad . The quality is light years ahead of the W330 . I was attracted initially to the W330 because of its sleek look and small form factor ( the W370 does not have this sex appeal ) , but the W370 blew the 330 out of the water in terms of photo quality , especially autofocus ( always sharp ) and redeye reduction ( no redeye or hint of redeye at all in shot after shot ) . In sum , I purchased the W370 and have n\'t looked back . This is an excellent little camera and everything a digital camera should be . Takes excellent photos whether indoors or out , natural light or artificial , bright conditions or low , etc . I highly recommend this product . ',normal

It changes her perspective on the world and while there is no `` revolution of action \'\' for her ( meaning she does n\'t harness the power to make a global impact or anything quite as grand ) her perceptions and reactions are honest and breathtaking . I \'m not a huge fan of `` magic realism \'\' books because I find they tend to tilt towards overblown fairy-tale instead of moments of enchantment which enrich the story , but `` The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake \'\' is a perfect balance .

857,18_1_R1I9I1ORSIBEUF.txt,' This review could be summerd up in a short sentence : You are looking at the current killer appliance for personal entertainment . But I never , ever , do short reviews ... So here \'s the long story . Grab a cup of coffee , as this review answers questions you never knew existed . I have to admit that there have been few items that have captured and kept my enthusiasm for as long as the iPod Touch . Two years ago , I purchased the original Touch , last year I upgraded to the 32 GB , and now I have the 64GB version . Was the upgrade worth it ? And what are the things yet to be imroved ? Because even though the Touch is close to perfection , there are still many small things that can be improved . Hardware Physically , the new ( 64GB ) Touch is identical to it \'s 2nd generation brethren . It \'s polished crome backplate is slightly curved , making it fit your palm perfectly . As before , the fact that it \'s made from polished chrome will guarantee that it attracts fingerprints and scratches almost magically . I \'m no friend of any kind of protective covers , and my last ( 32GB ) Touch had to live in my pocket with my keys , coins , and other stuff I threw in with it . After a year , the backplate did pick up a lot of scratches , and I expect that the 64GB to fare no better . Personally , I would have preferred a brushed finish for the backplate . This may have caused problems with the readability of the customized engraving that Apple applies to the Touch on the backplate for no additional charge ( a nice \'touch \' that becomes increasingly important as the Touch becomes more ubiquitious ) . This custom engraving you can only get if you order the Touch through Apple ( it \'s also not available in the Apple Stores ) . The front plate is made from one of the most impressive glass enhancements I \'ve ever seen . After a year of heavy abuse , my old Touch \'s glass front has not a single scratch - not one . I do n\'t know how Apple does it , but this is really impressive . Remember , I do n\'t use any protective covers or films . The screen itself is brilliant , bright , and can easily be read outside , wich is a feat in itself . The Touch has an ambient light sensor , so it can dim the screen when the surroundings are darker . This time around , the screen \'s color temperature has remained unchanged ( the 2G shifted all colors from a blueish to a more golden tinge ) . Movie playback is simply astonishing . The image is crisp , and the on-screen controls natural . Again , there are niceties such as double-tapping the screen to change aspect ratio , or placing bookmarks etc . You still ca n\'t set a movie \'s contrast , but beyond that small issue , movie playback is perfect . Viewing movies on the Touch simply works great , but personally I think that the screen is too small to watch a full movie . Last week , I tried watching a TV episode while on a plane enroute to Hamburg ( a 75 minute flight ) , but quickly decided against it , opting instead to play a game of \'Luxor \' . Somehow I prefer a larger screen for consuming video , while I have no problems doing something interactive on it . Still , video plays great on the Touch . Button and interface lay-out has remained the same from the last generation : volume controls on the left side , top holds the \'exit/on \' button , buttom has dock and phones connectors , and the front holds the single home button . There is one thing that can be improved here : I would have preferred the audio connector to be on top ( or either side ) , as the current configuration precludes the use of many applications ( e.g . News- and eBook readers ) when you want to place it upright -- for example in the Gym . Some apps do use the accelerometers and can be used positioning the Touch upside down , though . The built-in speaker is unchanged from the last version . It \'s weak , tinny , mono , produces horrible sound , has no volume to speak of -- and yet it \'s one of the best additions to the Touch ( the original did n\'t have it , the 2nd gen did ) . It simply makes casual gaming so much more fun . I do n\'t care about the bad sound quality , I just love the fact that it \'s there . The signatory white earphones that Apple sells with the Touch may look good , but I do n\'t like them . In my ears they are too uncomfortable . Since I \'m no audiophile , I ca n\'t comment on their audio quality other than that it \'s good enough for me . Anyway , I replaced them with my favorite non-Apple version . The hitch here is that Apple now delivers the 64 GB ( and 32 GB ) with earphones that sport a built-in mic and remote . And my head phones do n\'t have that . While the remote is nothing much to write home about ( the way it works is just too complex ) , the mic works well , and has just the right fidelity to pick out voice over the background noise . So , for now , I keep the white buds with me in case I want to use the IP-telephony capabilities . Battery life appears to have been reduced somewhat from the 2nd gen - at least on paper . During the past few days the new 3rd gen Touch certainly performed as well as or even better than my 2nd gen - but then again , that one \'s battery is already one year old . One fact that I \'ve become very fond of is the quick-charge ability , which works really well . The built-in wireless connectivity is really nice , with astonishingly well executed integration . The touch does all it \'s wireless networking over WiFi and Bluetooth . WiFi works really well ( especially here in Switzerland where Hotspots are particularely dense ) , and Bluetooth integration ( which I tried on the 3rd gen for the first time ) is flawless . WiFi reception ( range ) lags somewhat behind that of a Wintel laptop ( no doubt due to the metal backplate ) and is pretty much on par with that of a 15 \'\' Macbook Pro ( which is also somewhat lacking in WiFi reception range ) . WiFi is still the \' g \' variant though [ interestingly enough , the built-in hardware does support 11n , but so far Apple has chosen not to activate it , presumably to conserve battery . This is interesting also from the fact that in the 2G Touch , Apple initially included Bluetooth capabilities , but only activated it with a later OS release . Perhaps the same can be expected for 11n ] . Bluetooth now also works with headphones and BT-based car integration kits ( works well in mine ) . I would have loved to try out BT-based printing from the Calender or Addressbook app , but hit a snag : it appears no Touch app supports printing ... Missing Hardware There is some hardware that I expected , or whished that it was included in the Touch - especially as ( some ) of them are now present on other iPods : No camera . I was somewhat ambivalent about this . No camera means no pictures and/or movies . But it also means that I can keep handling it rough , as I do not have to worry abou the lens . Also , I do n\'t have to worry about taking it to the Gym ( my Gym has very strict rules towards camera-equipped items ) . All things being equal , the addition of a camera ( still and/or video ) would have been nice , but I do n\'t miss it much ( truth be told , I yet have to use the camera on my mobile phone ) . Unfortunately , there is also no built-in mic . This is much a more significant omission than having no camera . The Touch is a first class audio voice recorder and ( more importantly for me ) a first class Skype client . There are third party solutions for this ( a mini-micro that directly plugs into the headphone connector ) , but if the touch had a built-in mike , it would make using world-class applications like Shazam ( and Skype ) so much easier Likewise , there is no compass , nor a GPS receiver present in the touch . I understand that these are left out to better differentiate the Touch from the iPhone , but I would have welcomed them in the top-of-the-line ( 64GB ) version of the iPod . And , finally , there is no radio receiver . I \'m definitely not a radio man , as I next to never listen to it . Still , some people do ( as the ton of nicely selling IP radio applications shows ) , and anyway , the Nano has it now - even with a nice Tivoesque pause feature ! Why not the Touch ? Strange design choice . iPod & iTunes The original iPod \'s strength was the sheer brilliant ease of use - and the touch-based interface represented a mile-stone in improving on that . To date there simply is no better multimedia interface than that of the Touch/iPhone . It \'s natural after just a few seconds . It \'s drop-dead beautiful , with muted highlights , and cleverly accentuated by small ( if flashy ) animations that convey the different metaphors of the interface ( e.g . the rubber-banded bouncing when you reach the end of a playlist ) . Like no interface before you can instantly use it to accomplish even complex tasks with just the flick of a finger . Using it is sheer , unadulterated fun . The \'Coverflow \' album browsing may be one of the least useful , but it \'s definitely the most natural ( and fun ) way to flip though you music . And it is jaw-droppingly well executed ( note : when you use coverflow you should make sure that you have installed the all cover art from any music you did not purchase from the iTunes Store ) . At the base of all iPod music playing is the Playlist , and using playlist on the Touch is a joy . The interface whileplaying is also mature , offering niceties such as displaying a song \'s lyrics on a single tap , along with singularily simple controls for repeat and shuffle play . Unfortunately , this playlist feature also still has one of the most glaring shortcomings : the Touch is unable to play playlist groups . I usually group a small bunch of songs into very short playlist ( e.g . \'10 best Springsteen \' ) , and then mix these playlist into larger ones by simply dropping a playlist into a group . Although iTunes supports this , all versions of the Touch have stubbornly refused to do that . Also somewhat strangely missing on the Touch is the ability to search for an Artist or music title . Considering the fact that more than 10\'000 songs fit onto the device the need for an ability to search for something would seem obvious ( note : the Touch * does * have a global search function , which will also turn up songs - along with contacts and mails that match your search phrase . Having to leave the iPod app simply to look for a song is against everything Apple \'s ease of use is about , and it \'s not what I would expect ) . And while we are at it , I \'d love the ability to also search the lyrics , but that would be the icing on the cake . What is present , and what continues to amaze me is a function that I initially dismissed as some way to sell song : Genius Playlists . What it does is that given a song it finds other songs you already possess that would play nicely together . Since I have lots of songs ( else I would n\'t be purchasing the 64GB ) , this feature has helped me to get an incredible amount of additional joy out of my music . There are lots of gems hidden that mass of music I never knew I owned . Of course , if you want to , Genius will also recommend songs you do n\'t have but can buy right now on iTunes . That , of course , is the \'sell song \' angle . But at least it \'s incredibly well executed ( and yes , I \'ve used it ) The 64GB now also supports voice recognition - and I \'m sure it \'s a marvel of technology . But ( much like the auto-correction system for text ) it mostly only works in English . If you have set your system to German , you must pronounce english band names as they would be read aloud by a german-only speaker . Do it once , and everyone in the room stares at you . You \'ll never do it again . Plus , due to the greater complexity of the german language ( I am german speaking ) , the commands only work half the time . A nice idea , and a boon while driving or typing . But * only * when set to english . Rounding out the audiovisual feature set is the Touch \'s photo presentation ability , really showcasing the touch-based gesture interface . It was the pinch and flick gesture that originally sold me on the Touch , and it still does today . On the Mac , iTunes ties into iPhoto \'s image management , greatly facilitating the task of sorting out which images to synch to your iPod ( on windows , this task is slightly more pedestrian , as you \'ll have to manually manage the \'My Pictures \' folder ) . A strange quirk , though , is that during synch iTunes seems to downsample your images to a ( to me unknown , but definitely ) smaller size . Since I \'m a photo nut ( shooting with DSLR ) this \'feature \' annoys me somewhat , as iTunes currently does not provide any means to control the downsampling of photos . The success of the original iPod has left some competitors scratching their heads , while it is blindingly obvious to most users : the tight , seamless integration with iTunes . Now in version 9 , iTunes has become somewhat complex and not always that intuitive to use . It now also tries to manage Photos and Movies as well as Music and Applications . But iTunes is still very easy to use , and synchronizing the iPod Touch with iTunes is quick and simple . A small disappointment is the fact that you still ca n\'t synchronize your Touch wirelessly , and that it still refuses to mount as an external disk . Another disappointment is that although iTunes now allows you to share your music over the net with multiple Macs , it ca n\'t stream your Music to the Touch ( A small , brilliant app from the AppStore can do this for you , though ) . And while we are speaking of iTunes - there is one feature that I \'d love to have on the Touch : the visualizer . iTunes \' visualizer is really beautiful , and I would have loved the same functionality on my Touch . Internet While by itself the iPod Touch is an impressive and fun device , it comes into real swing when connected to the internet . The always-on nature and graceful handling of connection drops make the Touch one of the best internet devices I \'ve used to day . The included Safari internet browser performs great - unless you try to load Flash-based content , which is not supported . The email client works great for receiving and viewing mail . Writing anything but the shortest of email is annoying , as the Touch is simply too small for comfortably entering any significant amount of text . Calendar and Address Book are well executed ( even if entering a new date and merging multiple calenders is slightly more convoluted than necessary ) . Mail , Calendar and Addressbook can ( if you have that service available ) synch live to either mobile me ( which Apple loves to sell you ) or Exchange ( which your employer loves to force on you ) through a feature that is very similar to \'push \' notification . In the past , using Exchange has been somewhat spotty , and mobile Me has had it \'s own share of problems . All in all , though both work nice , and exceedingly quick . You do need to be in range of a hotspot for this to function , though . Somewhat disappointing is the fact that notes are not synched . Another nice addition is \'Voice Memos \' which is an audio recorder . Had the Touch an internal mic , this app would have been even better ... Applications Next to the \'productivity \' or \'PDA \' suite ( Mail , Calendar , Contacts ) the touch comes with some other nice ( but somewhat dull ) apps ( e.g . Maps , Stocks , YouTube ) and two killer Apps : iTunes and App Store . While the former gives you instant access to all songs and movies that are currently available on iTunes ( Warning : that , plus the incredible \'Shazam \' can lead to unintented gross music spending ) , the latter ( App Store ) gives you equal instant access to an incredible number of applications that you can instantly download and use . The quality of applications on the App Store is quite uneven , and tends to cluster around some rather puerile topics ( as a veritable , uh , heap , of Fart applications proves ) . That being said , there are a number of jaw-droppingly good applications that are able to utilize the touch interface ( and other capabilities such as accelerometer ) in new and surprising ways . Just to name a few are the aforementioned \'Shazam \' that can identify a song being played and instantly link to iTunes ( you have to see it in action to believe it ) , Flight Control , where you manage an airport by drawing the flight path for each plane , Bloomberg that provides stock information in an exhaustive way , and Wemlin that shows an up-to-date timetable for when the next tram arrives at my station . No matter what , there probably is an application that supports you with it . And then there are games . Apple had quickly recognized that the Touch represents an immensely attractive and powerful game platform . Performance , screen , connectivity and control capabilities make it the ideal casual gaming platform . Accordingly , games represent by far the largest category in the App store . While inevitably there are some truly awfully executed , or simply dull games , the majority of the available games are at least somewhat entertaining , while some rival and exceed those that can be had for thrice the price on dedicated gaming platforms . In the past , my Touch quickly filled up with app after app that I simply could n\'t live without any more , and an unforseen limitation of the Touch \'s design surfaced : app management . Applications are arranged as icons on a 4x4 grid per page , with multiple pages that you can flick left and right to navigate . Unfortunately , re-arranging apps , although possible ( and quite ingeniously implemented ) is still a chore . Apple has done the right thing , and integrated a much nicer app manager into the ( PC/Mac ) iTunes application . Speed Improvement The iPod Touch , although seen by some as the \'iPhone \'s smaller sibling \' was always either as nible as the phone , or even faster . The new , 3rd gen Touch is said to be \'up to 50 \% faster \' than the previous generation . To be honest , I \'m not sure that I see that speed improvent translate to much performance increase . That may be due to the fact that my Touch seldom maxes out on processor throughput or ( for example when browsing ) that WiFi bandwidth is the limiting factor . Some apps appear to be \'snappier \' during start-up ( smaller apps ) or execution ( games , mostly ) , but all in all , the Touch pretty much seems to be as fast as the last generation . This leads me to believe that the real bottleneck is it \'s internal execution memory ( i.e . not the 64 GB storage , but processor memory ) , and ony applications that are specifically written to take advantage of new technology ( e.g . OpenGL ES ) . Or in other words : the overall speed has not been improved that much . SDK So you want to be a geek ? Already are ? You can write your own applications for the Touch if you like . I \'ve taken the plunge and downloaded the SDK . Note that you can download the SDK and develop for the Touch/iPhone without actually owning one . The development system comes with a iPhone simulator that you can use to test your applications without downloading them unto an actual device ( it does have some limitations : for example , the accelerometers are not simulated , and you have no indication of the true execution speed ) . Well , you do need a Mac for this ( although it can be a few years old ) . The SDK is impressive - overwhelming even if you are not used to Mac programming ( and almost prohibitively complex if you are not used to frameworks like Cocoa and object-oriented programming ) . Still , crunching out your first ( very basic ) appliction is surprisingly easy , and if you roll that way , you \'ll get addicted quickly . Summary : It \'s the killer personal entertainment device . Buy it . You know you want it -- especially if you have read this far . If you have the 2nd gen iPod , you may need to ask yourself if the slight speed bump and the additional storage is worth the hefty price tag . To me it was , but your mileage may vary . pros + world class touch/gesture interface + best iPod audiovisual experience around ( music , video , photos ) + killer feature : app store and application availability + killer feature : internet integration ( browsing and push technology ) + great movie playback + really good casual gaming device + slightly improved speed ( allegedly , only for some games ) + great integration with mobile me ( calender , mail sync ) or Exchange + really good SDK if you are geeky enough to roll your own apps cons - no built-in mic ( headphones do have them ) - polished chrome backplate ( I would have preferred a brushed finish ) - no gps , camera , compass - no radio ( nano has it ? ) - no sync of notes , no wireless sync of music/movies - spotty voice recognition in languages other than english - no control over downsampling of photos - no search function for music inside the iPod app - no visualizer ',normal

1069,3_6_R1V2DOTHFCTY2S.txt,' I absolutely loved this book . I became a big fan of Nicholls with his first novel ( A Question of Attraction -- originally titled `` Starter for Ten \'\' with its U.K . edition . ) I was a little letdown by his second -- The Understudy , which was fun , but not quite as good as his first . This book exceeds his first . He takes a great device -- following the lives of one couple on the same day over a period of 20 years -- and does a masterful job of storytelling with it . We go from the couple \'s idealistic college days -- they meet on the day of their graduation -- all the way into their late 30s , with all the physical and emotional changes that come during that timespan . We see the career missteps along the way , and all the various relationships they have while still remaining friends -- and the woman , Emma , always secretly in love with Dexter Mayhew , who has more than a few wild oats to sow before he realizes the woman he should be with is the one who \'s always been his best friend . The writing is absolutely marvelous . The dialogue is absolutely terrific -- the couple have a teasing/kneedling way of talking to each other and the reparteee between them remains funny and fresh throughout even though the novel is long -- 435 pages . To say much more would be to give too much away . But if you like insightful books about relationships that can touch all of your emotions , this is the book for you . I think structurally the way Nicholls manages to take you on an extraordinary trip from the first page to the very last is a tour de force . I had to buy this from amazon/uk because it was available in Britain a year before it became available in the United States , but I \'m so happy I got it .

Call me when you have a real twist . I imagine this book is lovely for ambitious twelve year olds who want to tackle a five hundred page novel . They will find it easy to do so , because Twilight reads like a painfully long letter an immature but stuck-up pre-adolescent writes to her pen pal . I am SO SAD this passes for good teenage fiction . And this is why , when someone announces she writes Young Adult fiction , that people say , `` Why do n\'t you want to write real books ? \'\' And that Sucks . ',ironisch
874,5_15_R37Y7DE9BNSYZ3.txt,' It is a tiny camcorder . It will easily fit inside cargo , jacket or baggy pockets . Of course with the extremely small size comes some limitations . This camera is not going to have the same picture quality as professional HD camcorders . But that said it is a very nice camera for shooting standard definition home movies . It has an excellent zoom . The battery and built in memory are going to give you about 3 1/2 hours of recording time . As for all the people who are complaining about trying to edit the footage ( that is because they are not using Macs . ) If you have an up to date Mac it is a breeze . I have an Intel Mac . I convert the footage with MPEG Streamclip ( Which you can download for free at the Apple Web site . ) And then it works fine with Final Cut Pro 6 . I convert it to Quicktime and then choose the DV setting . It works great . It also works just fine without MPEG Streamclip if you are using iMovie 08 \' . The whole process is quick and painless . No going through the whole tape to log and capture the footage . So If you are looking for a tiny SD camcorder that you can take anywhere and edit it with newer Intel Macs , this is a great choice . I think you will enjoy this camera . ',normal

880,5_20_R4PSJ5WSIFY4C.txt,' Review updated : July 17 , 2009 I do n\'t know what to say ... this is a great product ! I remember back in the \'80s , we had this crude epilator with a curved rubber tube with tiny slits in it that would open up on the bottom and then close as the tube rotated . Well , it did n\'t work worth a crap and it hurt like the devil when it did grab a hair . So a couple decades later and there \'s finally a epilator that works the way you \'d expect it to . And the greatest thing is , is that it does n\'t hurt in the long run . It \'ll hurt a bit at the beginning , especially when you \'re doing thick patches of hair , but subsequent sessions it actually feels good . Basically the density of the hairy area you \'re doing , the more it \'ll hurt . Think about it ... the more hairs you \'re pulling out at any given time , the more pain you feel ... makes sense , right ? But when you \'re just going afetr a afew strays or the sporatic regrowth , you \'ll hardly feel it . Anyway , here \'s the deal . Hair grows in cycles . Not all hair is above the surface at any given time . So when you epilate and you think you \'re smooth , do n\'t be suprised when you find new stubble a day or so later . But do n\'t worry , that \'s not hair you missed , that \'s NEW hair . Because when you pull it out , it \'s just as long as the other hair that you pulled out before . And how long is the hair under your skin ? You \'d be amazed . The pieces I measured were typically 5-6 mm long . And hair typically grows 1 mm per 5-7 days . So if you do the math , once your skin is totally epilated , ( usually over the course of a week ) , expect the advertised 3-4 weeks of smooth skin . And the thing is , is that if you epilate every month or so , over time , your hair will become finer and thinner . You may even experience total hair loss if and when any given follicle gives up producting hair . EDIT : I have n\'t found this to be true yet , but who knows ... The epilator drum or roller is very unique . It contains 40 metal flaps ( tweezers ) that move against plastic edges which grabs and pulls out the hairs as the drum rotates away from your skin . It really does n\'t take much of a hair above the surface for the tweezers to work either . That \'s probably one of the greatest thing about this epilator . ie . you do n\'t have to wait days for hair to grow to a certain length to epilate them . You can do it with 24 hours or so . This epilator comes with several different heads and attachements . It comes with the epilator head with two snap-on attachements that supposedly alleviate the pain for new users . I found out that the one with the rollers was n\'t really necessary . The advanced user head makes you use the epilator at a 90 degree angle from your skin . It also helps keep the RPM at a high rate . But it hinders fine placement in those hard to get areas . At which point , it \'s just as well if you do n\'t use an attachment and go with the bare drum . The other head is a oscilating razor with foil grill as seen in many other razors of this sort these days . However , being a Braum product , it works really well . The razor also has a leading trimmer for those long hairs that wo n\'t go into the foil . There \'s also an attachment that supposedly cuts long hair at the preferred length for optimal epilation . The spotlight on the on/off switch is excellent . It \'s one of those little LED bulbs that are used in those multi-LED flashlights , so it is pretty bright . It is kind of necessary in non-flourescent lighting as I notice that if I go outside in sunlight I can see a bunch of hairs ( stubble ) that I did n\'t know I had . Anyway , if you want the very best of modern epilators , get this one . It \'ll save you tons of money in disposable razors and/or waxing . It \'ll pay for itself in just one month . EDIT : The new Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is supposedly more efficient , but it has mixed reviews . Some say it \'s wonderful , but others say older models of different brands work better . ',normal

888,38_13_R2AKN2WHEPS0SC.txt,' Never mind that Clash of the Titans play fast and loose with the mythological story of Perseus . Never mind that Medusa was n\'t a Titan . Never mind that the Kraken is from Scandinavian mythology , and that casting Lawrence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 version was sort of typecasting . The new Clash of the Titans is a darker , grittier more realistic Bronze age world than the 1981 version , but the story hasn ` t changed all that much . The citizens of Argos have become disenchanted with the rule of the Gods . The Gods have caused too much chaos and ruin to their lives so they \'ve decided to take their destinies into their own hands , and destroy the temples and statues of the Gods . In doing so , Perseus \' ( Sam Worthington ) family is killed by a falling statue of Zeus . When Zeus ( Liam Neeson ) learns of the desecration urged on by Hades ( Ralph Fiennes ) , he decides to destroy the city in four days or they can offer the sacrifice of the King of Argos \' daughter Andromeda ( Alexa Davalos ) . In a visit to the throne room of Argos , Hades lets it slip that Perseus is a son of Zeus , a demi-god . Being told of his near divinity , Perseus and a group of soldiers go off on their quest to save the city . The special effects are great ! The monsters look real and the characters realistically interact with them . In 3D the water roiling off the undulating tentacles of the Kraken must look really cool ! The problem is they shortchanged the story in favor of the special effects . The story only follows the barest of outlines of the myth . Same with the 1981 version , although it \'s a little more faithful to the myth . The most glaring lapse is there really is n\'t any reason for Perseus to save Argos . In the myth his reason to save the city is for the love of Andromeda . In this version he \'s a stranger to Argos and does n\'t fall in love with Andromeda . She \'s barely a consideration until she \'s needed to be sacrificed to the Kraken . The only reason he seems to take up the quest is because he \'s the nearest handy demi-god that can help out . Worthington \'s Perseus does n\'t seem very heroic , there does n\'t seem to be any emotional investment in Perseus in either the quest or the surrounding characters . Most of the time he has a stoically sullen , put upon attitude , and this keeps the audience at arms length from the character . He doesn ` t seem to embrace the heroic at all . Yes , he kills the monsters , but the tasks he must accomplish like tricking the Stygian witches and figuring out how to survive the encounter with Medusa , he seems to accomplish almost by accident . It seems that Perseus is n\'t meant to be heroic . he repeatedly says he wants `` to do this ( the quest ) as man , not a God , \'\' and he keeps refusing the gifts of the Gods . The message in the myth is for mortals to find the divine , to find the god , the hero within themselves , Perseus \' refusal of the gifts of the Gods , is the refusal to find the hero within himself . The 1981 version , although a bit campy in it \'s delivery tells the hero \'s story better . The 2010 version delivers better on the special effects . If such a thing were possible as to merge the strengths of both , you would have a better movie .

892,45_17_R2RHPEBF7R7VGL.txt,' I went into Watchmen with high expectations because I know that it \'s suppose to be like the best graphic novel ever . but I was not only horribly disappointed , but utterly disgusted . Watchmen is a film filled with over the top preachy narration and lines with little storyline advancement because of all the flashbacks and tries to make you understand the alternate history , that the first 3/4 of the film you have absolute no idea what it \'s trying to get at ( unless , of course you are familiar with the graphic novel it \'s based upon ) . Then at the end you realize that it \'s the same old same old ( though only universaly WESTERN idealism ) : * human beings are inheritantely corrupt ( thanks alot ) * peace can only be achieved through catastrophe , in other words , without apocalyse or apocalyptical events , there can only be war ( which I only agree to the degree that if you kept trying to convince people this , the religious fundies ought to be VERY HAPPY when they see this film ) * There has to be a god-like scapegoat for it to be happen , and it \'s gon na be American ( sorry Jesus Christ ) , and he will not actually be responsible for the apocalypse , only scapegoating it ( ergo : if some God-like creature destroyed the entire human race , it \'s probably not his fault but corrupt human beings \' ) last but not least that made me most angry : * women : if you got pregnant from rape , you should ALWAYS have the kid , because the kid will always turn out to be the best thing that ever happen to you . I have to admit that Watchmen hides its clichedness well , it was n\'t until the very end did I actually realize all this . But there was a point in which I thought it might head into a though-provoking direction , that it might actually get at a point that makes you go `` hmm ... interesting , \'\' and that \'s when Dr. Manhattan raise the conscience : what is so special about the lives of human beings , or lives in general , most part of galaxy ( or universe if you \'ll make that assumption that earth is unique with life ) get along just fine without life . Interestingly good point , cool , that made me think for a moment then it got destroyed by the bottom-of-the barrel foolish `` epiphany \'\' of Dr. Manhattan that he should save human race because of Silk Spectral number two , because she is something good that came out of chaos . Therefore life must be special if `` good life \'\' can come out of chaos . If you just sit there and think this though for a moment you \'ll see that this logic makes absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER . Why ? because if you already take the assumption that all lives ( and non-lives ) are equal , as Dr. M suggests because he \'s so high and mighty and all that , then how would `` rape \'\' be catagorized as `` chaos ? \'\' Rape and rape-like things happen often in the animal and , some would argue , plant and bacterial kingdom . It \'s only the fact that rape brings suffering to human beings , and we , the human beings , must PERCEIVE it as chaos because it brings suffering to us ( mostly the women ) , will makes it `` chaos . \'\' So you must assume that : 1. there \'s something special and non-chaotic ( good ) about human lives 2 . Rape brings suffering/chaos therefore conclusion : 3. rape is chaotic . So this sudden `` epiphany \'\' of Dr. M basically just came out of nowhere , maybe it \'s because he does believe that human lives are special but just does n\'t wan na show it since he \'s god and all that and it \'s just too humiliating and difficult to suffer in love in his condition . Not to mention after all the talk of anti-life , he \'s actually pro-life ( not even pro-choice ) ! ! A friend suggested to me that ( he has read the graphic novel ) the point is the irony : corrupted human beings ( the watchmen ) are the ones to rise above to save the human race . interesting but whether or not the graphic novel perserves this idea , the movie certainly does not . Why ? because the watchmen ( in the movie ) who actually fought the crimes either did it to appease their own vanity ( to be like pharohs , to bring divine justice ) or did it for thrills ( which is like most of them ) . Hey apocalypse is coming , what better way to spend your Last Days then to have sex and kick some butt ? Dude I would totally go for it . Overall this film is painful to watch , especially for humanists/feminists like me .

893,39_11_R1984V6Z1RAME3.txt,' I had imported Demon \'s Souls in April , and finished it 3 times since then . I have a long review below but if you want a few sentences here it is : The game has an excellent atmosphere , great character customization , enjoyable combat , some unique online elements , but very little story and minimal npc interaction . It is also very unforgiving , but it is strangely addictive if you do n\'t get frustrated easily . It takes about 40 hours in your first play through . It \'s not because the game is huge ... It \'s because you \'ll die a lot and repeat a lot , which results in playing very cautiously ( which also adds to the atmosphere ) . * * * Review * * * Demon \'s Souls is an action RPG game with some unique online elements . I loved the game but I can also see why some people ( even RPG lovers ) might hate it . Although I gave it 5 stars , I can not say the game is for everyone . Just read the paragraph at the end where I explain some game mechanics , and if it sounds frustrating to you then might want to try the game first before buying . For me 3 things are very important for an RPG . A good story and well-developed characters , deep character customization , tactical and fun combat . Story In DS , the people in different realms/worlds are possessed by demonic souls and you are to get rid of them . When you kill them you collect their souls and get more powerful and eventually fight against the final demon . That \'s basically it . The game has very little story and minimal amount of non player characters ( NPCs ) . There are about 15-20 NPCs in total ( including the merchants and blacksmiths ) , and most of them are located in a hub called Nexus . Furthermore , you can talk to them but there are no dialogue trees . They \'ll say 2-3 new sentences after each time you kill a demon boss , giving you some background about the setting . Sometimes they \'ll initiate a sidequest , by asking you to find/do something . That \'s all . If you are expecting something like Mass Effect or JRPGs in terms of story or dialogue this is not it . However , the game has a very dark and immersive atmosphere . It just sucks you in and makes up for its lack of story . Also , sometimes new characters/enemies appear depending on World Tendency ( world tendency is something like an alignment that can change toward black or white ) , which provides replay value . In sum , unlike most other RPGs , this is not a game that you play for the story . There is minimal story and dialogue , but the game has an excellent atmosphere which gives you the feeling of being alone and overwhelmed . Character Customization Character customization is probably the most important aspect of an RPG and this is where the game shines . You start the game with a certain class you picked , but it does n\'t restrict you . You can develop your stats in anyway you like and completely turn it into something else ( kind of like Oblivion ) . For example , weapons/armors have different stats requirements , but they are not restricted to classes . As long as your character meets the stats requirement you can use it . So you can mix and mash classes anyway you like . There are 8 different attributes , and when you level up you can raise one of those attributes by one point ( there is room for up to 99 for each attribute ) . Weapon upgrades are done by using the ores you find . You can do regular upgrades ( e.g . long sword +2 ) or you can change it into a different weapon ( e.g . dragon long sword ) depending on the ores you found . There are several different types of ores that opens a different upgrade branch . There are also some special upgrades , if you choose to use a demon \'s soul that you obtained from a boss , which will give you a unique weapon . Combat The customization also affects your gameplay . For instance , you can wield double swords , sword and shield , sword and crossbow , sword and a wand , two shields ( if you want to be fancy ) etc . Moreover , any sword can be wielded two handed or one handed . Of course , if you choose to wield a two handed sword with one hand , you character becomes clumsy . If you choose to wield a one handed sword with two hands , then you make stronger attacks with different animations . The combat is in real time and it is like an action game . In the controller , L1-L2 is assigned to the left hand , and R1-R2 is assigned to the right hand . L1 is used for guarding , L2 is either for parry ( when wielding a shield ) or attacking ( weapon on left hand ) ) . On the other hand , R1 is regular attack , and R2 is strong attack . You can also roll , run , but you can not jump . So you end up having different combat gameplay and tactics depending on what you choose to equip . Online Gameplay If your PS3 is connected to the internet , you \'ll automatically play the game online . That lets you do different things . First , you \'ll see some messages left by other players . They can provide some clues , warnings etc . You can also leave messages but you can only create them by combining preset words and phrases . You can not type whatever you want . And if someone finds your message helpful and rates it , then your health replenishes . Second , you \'ll see pools of blood and if you touch them it will show you a ghost of some other player and how he/she died . It \'s just another clue to help you in the game . Third , and the most important one , is playing with/against others . If you are in body form , you \'ll see blue signs on the ground left by other players . By touching those signs you can summon up to two more people to your game and they \'ll fight along with you in your game helping you out . On the other hand , when you are in body form some other player can invade your game and try to kill you . If you are in soul form , then you can put a blue sign on the ground in order to be summoned by others or you can use an item to invade another player \'s game . However , you can not just invite your friends to your game . If you and your friends are on different servers ( which you have no control over ) you wo n\'t see the signs they left and will not be able to summon them . If you happen to be on the same server , you can arrange a location in the game to put the sign ( via XMB message ) and then summon the other person . Conclusion In sum , Demon \'s Souls is one of the best games on PS3 . It has a great atmosphere and addictive gameplay that makes you come back , even after you died for the tenth time in the same boss battle . Unfortunately it is not a game for the impatient . Just take a look at the cover art ( the regular cover art which happens to be the Deluxe Edition cover in US release ) of the game . You see a lone , battered knight , who is about to give up . That \'s Demon \'s Souls for you . If you are willing to take the challenge , victory will be very satisfying . * * * About the difficulty and potential frustration * * * First of all , the game is very unforgiving . Even regular enemies can kill you with 1-2 blows , and they will kill you many times . However that \'s not the main issue . The real difficulty comes from not being able to save in the middle of a stage/map . The stages do n\'t have checkpoints either . Also dying is very costly . When you die , first you will drop your souls at the location you died ( You gain souls by killing enemies , and souls are used as both experience points to improve your stats and also as money ) . Then you will lose your body ( which means losing half of your life bar , making the game even harder ) and you will respawn in soul form at the start of the stage . However all the enemies will also respawn . Furthermore , if you die again before reaching the location you died , you will lose all the souls you have dropped previously for good . That means no experience/no money from all that playing . Also reaching your corpse does not give your body back , it only gives back your collected souls . You can gain your body ( half of your life bar ) if you beat a boss , or invade another player \'s game and kill him/her , or use a special item . In brief , you will be playing the same stage from the beginning over and over again , until you beat the boss at the end of the stage . In a lot of cases , you will not gain any experience/level during this process , because you \'ll die a second time before reaching your corpse . However , the stages are not very big . It generally takes about 5 to 10 minutes to get to the boss if you know the way and IF you do n\'t die . A new respawn point appears at the end of the stage , after a boss is defeated . ( The game has 5 worlds and each world has 4 stages/bosses ) . So , after you beat a boss you can spawn from that location if you want . Still , a lot of people would probably hate this no save/checkpoint mechanic combined with the games unforgiving difficulty . It \'s like 80s arcade games which takes you back to the beginning of the stage when you die . ',normal

895,23_5_R7HY9BRZ2Z6E4.txt,' After so many years of tentative and superficial studies that barely begin to enter the deep and satisfying world of Wagner \'s Ring , it \'s fantastic to read a book that \'s unafraid to go straight to the bottom of it . Di Gaetani situates the Ring within its entire cultural context , even discussing the gross abuse meted out to it by Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in the classic Looney Tunes cartoon . Common criticisms of the piece revolve around the contention that large stretches of leitmotiv render the piece rather flaccid , making it difficult for Wagner to take the listener to a successful climax . Di Gaetani rips apart these arguments , showing how the sensitive listener can luxuriate in the Ring for the full fifteen hours without it losing its delicate structure . In an epilogue , the author notes the vastly increased freedom that composers have found after being shown the example of Wagner \'s Ring and the thousands of enthusiastic fans that have spent a lifetime enjoying it . Highly recommended . ',normal
896,49_17_R29JI0DNQKKPHG.txt,' I think this is definitely my favorite book that I \'ve read so far by Jennifer Weiner . As much as there were sad things happening , it was uplifting at the same time . I really liked all of the characters . They completely seemed real to me . I kept thinking of Sylvie , the mom , and relating her to my mom . And how my mom is always there backing up my dad and how if my dad was unfaithful I could see the next series of events unfolding the same way they did in the book . I could also relate to a little bit of something in each of the sisters . They were both so different and started off so far apart emotionally but grew towards each other . I thought the plot seemed very realistic . And I loved the little pop culture/current events tidbits that were in the story . Some are so recent that I think its incredible that they \'re in the book . And I think that some women might not like the ending with Sylvie , but I did . Without giving away what happens , I think I would have made the same choice that she did . A great summer read ! ',normal
897,276423_7_R27Z9V295NCUH7.txt,' Spent a weekend reviewing various GPS devices to replace my less than 1 year old Mio C320 ( avoid these like the plague ) that had its battery die about 4 months after purchase . Went back and forth along the entire line of Garmin devices , and finally settled on this one for the blue tooth and traffic , neither of which I \'ll probably hardly ever use , but nice to have when I want them . I was disappointed with the map , the `` new \'\' 2009 one , because I have some streets in my neighborhood that have been around for over four years and they \'re not to be found on this unit . Even the piece of junk cheap Mio had these streets . But that \'s about the only downside there is to it , the only reason I have n\'t given it 5 stars . Having been used to the MIO , and the horrible refresh rate , it is a pleasant change to see smooth scrolling as my vehicle moves . The ability to change the car icon is nice , especially with the plethora of icons available on the garmin website . Accuracy is very good as well , and even in turns the unit is n\'t so laggy that it becomes annoying . And also unlike what I was used to with the MIO , when I come to a stop at the intersection , the map does n\'t start rotating randomly on me . Speaker is about as I expected , wo n\'t hear much over a loud stereo but crank it up enough you can at least hear it if you keep the music down a bit . The option to easily download voices is also appreciated . It did well with my testing of going point to point , following the instructions , and for the most part you \'re given the instructions in plenty of time . only once or twice did it not tell me `` turn right on such and such \'\' until I was about 20 feet from the street , but that was when I was coming up on stop signs and had slowed down , so it may be compensating for the speed factor . Recalculation notice is a bit annoying , my MIO would say it once , sometimes this says it three times before it starts to display the alternate route . Still has about 900MB free on the internal memory for additional voices , icons , maps , and such , and with the SD slot there \'s plenty of room to grow . I have a Verizon XV6900 phone with Windows Mobile 6.1 , and while the bluetooth paired well and it can see the phone status , battery power , signal , even dialed and missed call lists , it never does get the phonebook . it gets a random entry and that \'s it - so whenever I turn it on , I have just one user to select from , and it \'s different each time . Still have n\'t tracked that one down yet . But every other bluetooth option worked just fine . I \'m not a fan of the very thick double power cable for it though , and it would be doubly annoying ( no pun intended ) if I were mounting this somewhere higher up on the window to have that double cable dangling down . I can see how the ads would get annoying sometimes ( the free traffic is because it is advertising driven ) but you do n\'t get them at all if you turn off the traffic feature , and since most of my driving is n\'t around times that traffic is a concern , i can just leave it for when I really have a use for it . Good response to finger input , and while the unit is overall much better quality than the MIO , I really do miss the MIO \'s ability to have an info pane down the last third of the screen and the map on the first two thirds of it when desired . But there \'s some of that info available in the data bubbles on the bottom and top so I \'ll survive . Overall happy with the unit , it works well and was worth the cost . ',normal

900,25_4_R24CR2CYR8CJF.txt,' INTRODUCTION Mass Effect , by Electronic Arts ( EA ) , sets the benchmark for third person role playing actions games . It is as close to a DVD movie as a video game can get , because , unlike most first person games , players can see and hear the player character as well as the non-player characters ( NPCs ) . This movie-like quality greatly enhances the compelling story , which is the hallmark of the Mass Effect Trilogy . THE PLOT * * Spoiler Alert * * This second episode of the Mass Effect Trilogy begins with the death ( yes , DEATH ) of Commander Shepard , in a fiery ambush of the Normandy , two years after he/she defeated the traitorous Saren Arterius in the battle of the Citadel . But , thank the goddess , he/she is later resurrected in Project Lazarus by the Illusive Man , leader of Cerberus , a shadowy and ruthless `` human supremacist \'\' organization , for the sole purpose of sending the legendary commander to investigate a new cataclysmic event in the Galaxy : entire human colonies have been vanishing without a trace , leaving behind empty buildings . To confront the threat , Shepard travels across the Galaxy to recruit up to a dozen of the most dangerous characters to his/her elite team , at locations including Illium , an asari colony , and Omega , a lawless mining station built on a hollowed out asteroid in the Terminus Systems , for a mission from which every member of the team , including Commander Shepard , may never return . * * End of Possible Spoilers * * THE CHARACTERS Players who had completed Mass Effect 1 ( ME1 ) can import a Save Game from the list of Character Saves into Mass Effect 2 ( ME2 ) . During the file transfer , they have the option of changing the class of Commander Shepard , for example , from adept to vanguard , as well as his/her physical characteristics . This is possible in the storyline on account of Project Lazarus -- a very clever way of putting Shepard on reset . If Shepard was imported at a high level in ME1 , players will be awarded with bonus squad points and research metals at the start . ( See my comment below . ) All the NPCs who were alive at the end of the ME1 are transferred . Furthermore , the story in ME2 unfolds in accordance with the decisions made by the players in ME1 , for example , whether Shepard set the Rachni queen free in Noveria , whether he/she resolved the conflict with Wrex on Virmire peacefully , or whether he/she called in the human fleet to save the Council in the battle of the Citadel . For those who never play ME1 , ME2 can be played stand-alone with new characters and certain pre-set assumptions on events in ME1 . New characters in ME2 include Thane , a drell master assassin , Legion , a free-thinking geth , who is stalking Commander Shepard , and Subject Zero , a female human biotic gang and cult member , with head-to-toe tattoos . Other than the geth and the Reapers , new enemies emerge in ME2 . They include the Collectors , a winged insect-like species who are suspected to be working for the Reapers , and Scions , which are grotesque experiments of the Reaper , as well as monstrous beings created by the Reapers out of other species they abducted . THE GAME/COMBAT SYSTEM The Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and combat system have been vastly improved in ME2 . Gone are those annoying texture pop-ups in ME1 . So are those long elevator rides -- they are replaced with loading screens . Battle scenes are more realistic : enemies are thrown against walls , limbs are blown off , and wounded fighters continue to fight by crawling on the ground . Players can hit the enemies where they place the reticles , like in a shooter . ( This is not so in ME1 , where hits are calculated based on the number of skill points assigned by the players to the characters . ) Players can now issue attack orders to Shepard \'s squad mates by using the directional-pad of the controller ( of the Xbox 360 ) , and manually prompt Commander Shepard to duck behind covers . The limitless ammo is no more in ME2 . It is replaced with removable `` thermal clips \'\' . When a clip is spent , it must be ejected and replaced with a new one . Players are therefore advised to take note of the amount of thermo clips available during battles . Instead of only four weapon types as in ME1 , there are nineteen in ME2 . One of my gripes with ME1 was the lack of heavy hand-held weapons . In ME2 , they are available to the soldier class player character ( as well as Commander Shepard of all classes ) . These heavy weapons knock down multiple enemies in one gigantic blast . A sentinel class player character now dons an ablation tactical armor , which makes him/her very tough to kill . An engineer class player character can launch a drone to aid him/her in battle . An adept class player character can spawn micro-singularities around the enemies , annihilating them en masse . Tactical cloak , which renders a combatant invisible briefly , is available to an infiltrator class player character . A vanguard class player character can dash around the battlefield with a new biotic power -- the `` biotic charge \'\' , which propels him/her forward at tremendous speed and force , to attack or evade the enemies . There is no longer any class restriction in armor . Medi-gel , used in the ME1 to regenerate health , is replaced with auto-regeneration , although the players still need it to cast the Unity reviving power . ( Note : auto-regeneration is also available in ME1 , but only as an upgrade to the armors . ) THE DIALOGUE The dialogue wheel in ME1 is the most innovative dialogue system in all the games I have ever played . When used probably , it delivers a continuous and seamless dialogue , and hence the movie-like quality of the game . In ME2 , the dialogue wheel is further improved . A new `` interrupt \'\' system is introduced . When prompted by the players with the left or right trigger of the controller ( of the Xbox 360 ) , Commander Shepard can interrupt the dialogue with `` heroic \'\' or `` hostile \'\' action to get the answer he/she wants . Furthermore , instead of the previous static camera position in ME1 , the camera moves around during conversations in ME2 , adding further cinematic effect to the game . THE CHOICES Like in ME1 , choices made by the players influence the outcome of the game in ME2 . For example , in ME1 , on the planet Virmire , Commander Shepard ( and hence the players ) , was called upon to decide which of the two squad mates he/she would rescue ; the one left behind was consumed in a subsequent nuclear blast . In the same manner , decisions of the players in ME2 throughout the game may eventually lead to the annihilation of the entire ground team in the final mission , including Commander Shepard , or the survival of every team member , or something in between . Players with a `` dead \'\' Shepard will not be able to import him/her into ME3 . The same thing is true with a `` dead \'\' teammate . They can play ME3 with a generic Shepard , but not `` their \'\' Shepard . Furthermore , with Shepard killed , players ca n\'t return to the game world after the final mission and continue to play , for example , to complete a side quest , or to explore a new locale . They will have to start a new game or reload with a previous save-file and replay part of the game for a different outcome . This gives incentive to players to make sound decisions throughout the game , before heading into the final mission . THE CERBERUS NETWORK The Cerberus Network is a cleverly designed in-game portal through which players can access `` Downloadable Contents ( DLCs ) \'\' from EA . Players activate this network with a one-time access code , which is included in every new game purchase . Game renters and used game buyers will have to pay for the code . This arrangement is apparently a ploy by EA to combat the rental and used game market , which has been undermining retail sales of new games . Players who access the network will receive the first DLC pack on January 26 , 2010 , the date on which the game is released in North America . This first DLC introduces Zaeed , a rough and tumble mercenary who will join Shepard \'s elite team . A future DLC will introduce the Hammerhead , a hover tank to replace the much-maligned Mako in ME1 . ( Note : There is no driveable vehicle in the core game . ) In addition , new missions and in-game items will be released to gamers by EA through this network . CONCLUSION ME2 comes with 2 discs . Players have to swap discs ( twice per game ) at some points . There are 90 voice actors playing 546 characters with over 30,000 lines of dialogue . New voice actors in ME2 include D.C. Douglas , Martin Sheen and Adam Baldwin . In conclusion , ME2 is a role-playing game with the look and feel of a shooter . It is a must-have game of the year . ',normal

904,22_19_RFN0VMBINCH6S.txt,' Prior to reading this book , I knew little about either Sarah Palin or Alaska and I was interested to learn more about both , especially the book \'s author . Although famous in America , Sarah Palin could go just about anywhere in Britain completely anonymously as long as she did n\'t meet any Americans along the way . Frankly , Brits normally only take any notice of American politicians if they become president . There are exceptions such as Al Gore and Hillary Clinton , but they are rare . Contrast the number of reviews of this book posted in Amazon USA with the number posted in Amazon UK for confirmation of the lack of British interest . I realized early on in this book that I was going to enjoy reading it because Mrs Palin \'s story is both interesting and well-written . She makes summer in Alaska sound wonderful , although acknowledging that the winters are long and harsh . She discusses many aspects of her life and it is clear that she has strong views on a number of issues . Although not directly relevant to her political career , perhaps the most intriguing question about her beliefs concerns her stance on the origin of species . At first glance , Mrs Palin appears to be a full-blooded creationist , but she denies this . Apparently , she accepts what she calls microevolution , in which species change and evolve over time , but not that people are related to apes or monkeys . Her stance is interesting , but I prefer to accept Darwin \'s theory , despite the proof of it still being incomplete . Not having studied the American political scene closely , I \'ll leave others to judge the accuracy of the main story , but the politics as described here is explosive stuff . Corruption in Alaska , tales of in-fighting within the Republican party and dirty tricks played by some Democrats - all rather sad , but I \'ll say straight away that similar things happen elsewhere in the world including Britain . Hey , the summer of 2009 was dominated by the expenses scandal at Westminster , while all British political parties of any significance have had their internal fights at one time or another , in between playing dirty tricks on each other . So in one form or another , most of the political stuff here does n\'t surprise me , but some of it is shocking nevertheless . An unconventional politician in many ways , Mrs Palin nevertheless appears to have brought about significant changes in a number of areas in her home state of Alaska , which may seem to many people ( especially in my country ) like a frozen wasteland , but which is rich in natural resources and occupies a vast land area , approximately equivalent to France , Spain , Italy and the UK combined . So being governor of Alaska is not equivalent to running a small local council in Britain even though it is sparsely populated ( fewer people live there than in the county of Leicestershire in which I live ) . I suspect that the position of state governor may be equivalent to being leader of the Welsh assembly . The biggest Alaskan story by far in my adult lifetime was the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which Mrs Palin covers briefly ; she later had plenty of political fights with the oil companies ( including BP as well as ExxonMobil and others ) in her time as state governor . Mrs Palin has drawn plenty of criticism from a variety of sources and uses the opportunity that this book affords to hit back at those critics , often explaining how things have been distorted by the media . Having had my own relatively minor experience of being in British national newspapers , I have sympathy with victims of media distortion , so I do n\'t blame Mrs Palin for hitting back via this book , but I can see that others will react badly . At least my story was a one-day wonder with no lasting consequences , but things are different for those who go into politics , sport or showbiz . Mrs Palin clearly is n\'t impressed by the way the Republican presidential campaign was handled , and clearly feels that she was n\'t able to contribute effectively to the campaign , but the aftermath was even worse . While some Republicans were happy to cast her as the scapegoat , some Democrats launched a sustained campaign against her that exploited freedom of information laws . Ultimately , this created problems for the legislative process as well as personal difficulties for the Palin family , all described in detail , causing Mrs Palin to decide that she had to quit as governor with a year still to run , even though she was never found guilty of anything . As she acknowledges , that decision to quit may kill her political career , but Mrs Palin says that she did what she felt was right for Alaska . Inevitably in such situations , people will believe whatever they choose to . I expect Mrs Palin will return to public life in some capacity eventually . That might be as a presidential candidate , but it might alternatively be as champion of a cause dear to her heart . Her vice-presidential campaign generated enormous hope among disabled people , while her love of Alaska makes her passionate about environmental issues . So there \'s two obvious issues , but I \'m sure there are others . Would I vote for Mrs Palin , given the chance ? I do n\'t know because I \'d need to know more about issues not discussed in this book , but I \'d like the option . I can see why this book - and the author - are so controversial . Fans of Mrs Palin will love this book , while critics will be furious . Both are likely to have their opinions reinforced by reading this book . Coming from a position of ignorance , I \'ll just say that I found this book to be compulsive reading . ',normal

914,33_3_R2VT7XQ4UTN0HO.txt,' Austen \'s supposed satire of the gothic novel is tangled up with what would have been the finest fluff of effeminate fiction -- had anyone else written it . Austen , however , can not resist sinking her sharp little claws into naivete , romance , and ( of course , this IS Jane Austen ) men . I will say , it is the only book of hers that I have ever been able to finish . No one would want to be quite as stupid as poor Catherine , but we \'ve all been naive . Personally , I envy Catherine the ability to be so pure and trusting with the object of her affection -- as jaded and overeducated a modern woman as I am , I find myself reading the story with no feeling so strong as a wish that ( after closely and cynically examining him ) I could meet a man with whom I felt free to admire his perfections and flaws as the finest in the world ! ( I \'m sure there \'s one out there . ) I \'m sure Miss Austen would find this proof that I am as contemptibly stupid as Catherine , but when we kill our inner innocent completely , then we have made life unworth living , and I pity all the people with whom we live and work . The book would be much better if it did n\'t dawdle with condemning feminine sweetness & amp ; innocence & amp ; male behavior \'s apparently universal ( to Austen ) unacceptability , particularly in tarring them all with the same brush . It would be far better if bereft of the perfunctorily & quot ; happy ending & quot ; which is treated in such a way that love and marriage wind up reeking of as much of Austen \'s contempt to at least the same degree as Mrs. Radcliffe \'s literary crimes . If you want to see this story the way it should be , the way it \'s funny , check out the movie ( an episode of Masterpiece Theater ) .

In the case of Mel Brooks , through whose corporeal shell the Visitors had crafted THE PRODUCERS , BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , that means a pushy , tiresome , obnoxious hack . Well , it \'s as good an explanation as any , right ? Brooks so totally lost the plot from the latter half of the 70s on that bodysnatching aliens and Faustian bargains spring naturally to mind as reasonable explanations : that \'s how fast , and far , he fell off the cliff . There is n\'t a single funny moment in his ROBIN HOOD spoof , but this is far worse than simply `` unfunny \'\' . Few things in life are as painful to endure as third-rate comedy performed badly , by incompetents incapable of timing a gag or delivering even a throwaway line without stepping on the joke . Not that this is measurably worse than the half-dozen or so lead balloons Brooks made prior to this . On the other hand , it \'s every bit as wheezingly unfunny as they were . If it was n\'t , would Dick van Patten even be in this ? Yeah .... when I think of freewheeling , anything-goes absurdist satire , Van Patten \'s the first name that comes to mind .

921,23_18_RZ9VV4P855NHB.txt,' In almost every actor \'s career , there are some early film efforts that were clearly done just for a paycheck . If these actors had their way , these movies would be wiped off of the face of the earth and never mentioned again . Actress Alyssa Milano ( who got her start on the hit 80 \'s TV show Who \'s the Boss ? ) made quite a few of these type of movies early on in her hit/miss ( but mostly miss ) movie career . Most of them were essentially sub-par soft-core erotic thrillers ( like Embrace of the Vampire ) that just basically sucked on almost every level . Others were actually pretty good like Confessions of a Sorority Girl . Some may argue that she may have been trying to shed her wholesome image from her prior TV show Who \'s the Boss but I think that she was just desperate for work and would take anything she could get her hands on , no matter how bad the script was . Either that , or she actually thought that these were supposed to be good films . If that was the case she ought to slap her agent during that period ! A friend of mine recently lent me her 1995 film Poison Ivy 2 : Lily on DVD with the recommendation that it was good on a so-bad-it \'s good level . All I can say is that it was just bad on every level and actually made most USA Network sleazefests look pretty good by comparison . The film is a sequel ( in name only for the most part ) to the 1992 cult classic that starred a decidedly very sexy & 17 year old Drew Barrymore in the lethal nymphette role of Ivy . On a guilty-pleasure level the original movie worked due to the movie \'s reliance on solid acting instead of just wall-to-wall sex and nudity . Poison Ivy 2 involves Lily ( Alyssa Milano ) who is an art student/painter from Michigan who has just arrived in California to start attending an art school . She quickly finds a house that has a room for rent and quickly moves in . She starts attending her classes and quickly catches the attention of a male classmate . They start going out and it soon becomes obvious that Lily \'s much older ( and married with a child ) teacher has the hots for her as well and develops an unhealthy infatuation on her . Lily ends up inexplicably finding a hidden diary and nude photos from a girl named Ivy ( presumably the one from the first film ) and immediately becomes fascinated by Ivy \'s wild and free sexual ways . Lily immediately begins to start dressing in very revealing clothes and basically acting like a tramp , much to the surprise of her boyfriend ( who does n\'t mind one bit . ) Her teacher ends up talking her into letting him paint semi-nude portraits of her and before too long he ca n\'t resist his urges and starts trying to force her into having sex with him . She tries to refuse and eventually her boyfriend catches on and gets disgusted with her . She tries to confront her teacher about it at her house and he tries to practically rape her in the main hallway ( while his wife and young daughter are home no less ) . His daughter and wife catch them in the act ( WHOA ! ! I did n\'t see that coming ! ) and the little girl inexplicably runs out into the street and gets hit/killed by a car ( ! ) . Everyone exchanges some heated words and the movie ends . The plot , as you can tell , is predictable and thoroughly generic . Probably the worst part is that the running time of the movie is an unbearable 108 minutes . Most of the scenes go on ridiculously long and will more than likely cause unsuspecting viewers to doze off periodically . All of the actors involved look like they were blackmailed into making this movie . Alyssa Milano is there purely for the skin factor and all of the other cast trudge through their roles looking like someone slipped valium in their meals/drinks . As is almost always the case with direct-to-video skin flicks , Poison Ivy 2 is available in both unrated and R-rated versions . The DVD I watched included both the R and unrated versions of the movie on the same disc as well as offering a choice between widescreen or full frame viewing options . The only version that I checked out was the widescreen unrated version . According to the back of the DVD box , the R-rated version looks to be missing around 2 minutes of explicit sexual content . To be honest , I could n\'t really tell what about the uncut version caused the MPAA to demand cuts . Out of the whole film there are probably literally only 2 1/2 minutes of footage that feature any sort of nudity or sexual content . Even when sex does occur it \'s so poorly lit and the editing is so choppy that not that much is really shown . The sex scenes are also pretty brief for this dubious genre . There \'s one in particular that \'s good for a laugh in which a guy who is lusting after her confronts her in his room at some goofy party . ( It is rumored that this particular scene originally contained an explicit shot of Alyssa simulating oral sex on the male actor who played her boyfriend but that she forced the distributors to take that shot out of the film . The very beginning of this scene is present as you see her head makes its way down , but then it cuts away . ) Since this was an unrated film , there was tons of room to make a truly erotic and extremely explicit sex scene . But what we get is something that is n\'t that much more than we see in most R rated erotic films . Any shots that showed below the waist sexual activity usually only lasted for a second or two . ( The only scene that probably could have ruffled the ratings board \'s feathers was a brief sequence in which the sleazy teacher performs oral sex on Lily . ) All of the participants are clearly not that comfortable with the material which makes the few sex scenes boring , laughable and about as far from erotic as you can get . I \'ve seen R-rated films that were a ton more explicit than this . Once again , my main beef with erotic thrillers is that if you know you \'re making an unrated film , just go all out and make it as sexually explicit as you can . As can be expected , the sole reason most people will watch this movie is to see Alyssa Milano nude . While she looks great with her clothes off , it \'s clear that she was n\'t all that comfortable in those scenes and she just looks flat out embarassed in the sex scenes . And to be honest , she \'s not naked all that much in the movie . When she is it \'s mostly just shots of her fabulous breasts ( with a few moments of her toned bare butt ) , but unfortunately no full frontal . People would be better off just downloading the stills off of the internet instead of trying to make it through this piece of crap . This direct-to-video dud is a thorough waste of time and really is n\'t worth watching for any reason whatsoever . For a film that advertises itself as soft-core porn , it is sorely lacking in the sex and nudity departments and features instead some of the worst scenes and acting around . Only Alyssa Milano addicts will find anything worth salvaging in this mess , everyone else should just act like this movie does n\'t exist . Poison Ivy 2 : Lily is unrated and contains strong sexual content , nudity and language . ( as mentioned before the R-rated version is 2 minutes shorter and edits some of the more explicit sexual footage while also using some alternate camera angles . ',ironisch

923,5_17_R1A6U10UV6Z126.txt,' It has been a while since I \'ve encountered a horror novel of such magnitude and scope , but Justin Cronin \'s hefty tome `` The Passage \'\' seems poised to announce itself as the latest true `` horror epic . \'\' It \'s about time too ! Ambitious and thought-provoking , but filled with propulsive action and bloodshed , `` The Passage \'\' is the thinking person \'s genre thrill ride . This massive book starts in the near future with a pretty unique combination of vampiric lore meshed with science gone awry . But Cronin , while nailing these explosive first chapters , has much more up his sleeve . The expansive ( and sometimes it seems the story will never end ) plot resets several times until we have followed the confrontations to their inevitable conclusion many generations later . The comparisons to Stephen King \'s `` The Stand \'\' seem apt and , I believe , will be widespread . And in case anyone has a passing interest on where I fall on `` The Stand , \'\' I think it \'s the best book of its type that I \'ve ever read . Although the books are quite different in plotting and structure , thematically they share much . From the veritable destruction of the world as we know it , to the efforts to rebuild some semblance of a new world order , to the ultimate confrontation between good an evil replete with the requisite supernatural underpinnings -- both books challenge ordinary citizens to rise to extraordinary levels to champion the human cause . In the right hands , these apocalyptic epics can be unforgettable -- and I \'ll just say that Cronin \'s hands are quite capable . Do n\'t misunderstand the King reference , however , `` The Passage \'\' stands as its own unique portrait of a ravaged future . It \'s just that there are so few horror novels that set out to accomplish so much in storytelling . Cronin \'s novel is gutsy , challenging and filled with high level drama of the first order . It \'s not breezy or light entertainment , however . It \'s a serious reading commitment for those looking for their gore mixed with a lot of substance .

I have had some experience with LG Bluray before since I own the also excellent BD390 so when I needed another one for a different room in the house the newer model LG was at the top of my list . Having owned it for a few weeks I have the following to note . Pros 1 . Fast Blu-Ray loading times . Very crisp clear image and fortunately since I own a receiver capable of decoding Lossless HD formats I really like the sound as well . Does the Blu ray format justice 2 , My favorite aspect of this and the BD 390 by far is the VUDU functionality . I think Vudu is a tremendous service ( perhaps will get even better now that \'s its been purchased by Wal-Mart ) . To have a large library of 1080p HD available at your fingertips is fantastic and the LG does a nice job displaying very pleasing audio and video off Vudu . I would buy this for this feature alone . 3 , Although no shortage of Netflix ready devices in my HT lineup having this and other internet sources such as Pandora are nice options . 4 . I read some complaints about the new interface compared to the older LGs but to my eyes its nicer looking and just as easy to navigate 5 . I used Ethernet to connect this player but did test out the 802.11n and was able to connect to my Airport Extreme powered network with no problems 6 . CD ripping is a great feature and I was able to archive a library of 200 CDs or so with little trouble . Gracenote does a nice job tagging the tracks .

I would have liked if it supported Amazon VOD since that \'s my other source for video and I did think that the footprint was still a little large although sleeker and lighter that my older model .

927,25_19_R35DRT9CR9I02.txt,' I have just five words of advice for all you Amazon shoppers : do not buy this book . I mean it . Even if you do n\'t believe me when I tell you how bad it is , and you insist on reading it , do n\'t buy it . Borrow it from a friend or take it out from the library ( if you absolutely must ) . This drivel does n\'t even deserve your time let alone your money or shelf space . Judging from this book alone , Candace Bushnell is a horrible author . I \'ve yet to read \'Sex and the City \' , but I love the show . If that novel is anything like this trash , I \'ll have no choice other than to stay away . Not only is every character blonde , Bushnell must have run out of ideas because every character is either a model , an actor , a writer , or a business person . Oh , and they \'re all addicted to cocaine , like it \'s normal to be carrying around a vial of coke . It \'s sick , really . As you may or may not be aware , \'Four Blondes \' is not a novel about ( as the title suggests ) four blonde friends ( much like \'Sex and the City \' ) . Rather , it \'s four short stories about four different blondes . The first two stories are complete wastes of time . In fact , if I were you , I would n\'t even bother with those two . Even if you \'ve already taken the time to take the book out from the library . Of course , if you \'ve taken the time to visit the library and pick this trash up , you \'ve obviously decided against heeding my advice anyway , in which case , you may as well go ahead and continue to ignore me . The second two stories ar n\'t much better than the first , but I found them to be the lesser of two ( or in this case , four ) evils . The first story is about an ex-model named Janey Wilcox . She \'s a manipulative sleaze who cares about no one except herself . She also loves using men for their summer homes in the Hamptons , and does n\'t care if she dispises these men , she \'ll still sleep with them . Janey is shallow , vain , and wants to do `` something \'\' with her life ( here \'s an idea , get a job you trashy , evil woman ) . She loves ruining other people \'s lives and then expects them to , not only care , but actually come running to her aid when she \'s managed to dig herself into a situation she could have avoided if she was a decent human being . She hates her sister , Patty , because Patty \'s successful , happy , and a good person . I liked Patty . Usually , ar n\'t readers supposed to like the primary , rather than the secondary , characters ? The second story is about Winnie and James Dieke . They \'re a married couple who never should have gotten married in the first place . You think Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson are a match made in I-can\'t-believe-how-unbelievably-stupid-spoiled-and-annoying-we-are Heaven ? Well , then you \'ve never been introduced to the Diekes . They \'re both journalists and , basically , they hate each other . Winnie is over-controlling , and wants desperately to be successful and famous , whilst James has basically given up on life and is annoyingly frightened of everything . He \'s a wimp , a pushover , and an all around lazy guy . He \'s terrified that Winnie will leave him ( oh , how will he go on without her telling him how to put on his socks ! ? ) , but she wo n\'t because she \'s still determined that being married to him with further her career . Oh , did I mention they have a son ? Probably not , since they basically pay him no attention , and his name is never even mentioned in their story . What great people the Diekes are ! The third story is about Princess Cecelia . She \'s a self-absorbed snob who acts horribly to everyone , even her husband , Hubert . She seems to think she \'s head and shoulders above everyone else in the world because she \'s managed to marry the Prince of Luxenstein . She \'s basically insane . No , seriously . She \'s completely paranoid and is convinced her family is trying to kill her . She treats her husband like scum , even though he does absolutely nothing wrong . She \'s jealous of every other woman who \'s ever been in Hubert \'s life , and is convinced he \'s having an affair . She relies on other people for , basically , everything . And , even when they \'re trying to help her , she \'s discustingly rude . She does whatever she wants , whenever she wants , and when she does n\'t get her way she complains about it and acts like an idiotic snot . The last story is the shortest , which is unfortunate because it \'s the least offensive of the lot . It \'s about a journalist who refers to herself simply as `` grasshopper \'\' . She writes for a magazine , answering women \'s questions about sex . She \'s been sent to England to compare the sex-lives of Londoners with those of New Yorkers . She basically meets a lot of different people , has different conversations with both men and women , and picks up a lot of different veiwpoints on different ideas and beliefs . This story is n\'t funny , but it \'s hilarious compared to the first three ( in case you were thinking this entire book was going to be a `` laughfest \'\' ) . Well , I obviously do n\'t recommend this book , as I \'ve made perfectly clear . If I had to ( and by that , I mean , if I was forced at gunpoint , because there \'s no other way I \'d ever willfully open this garbage again ) read it again , I think I \'d start from the end .

And then set the variable low pass filter on the sub-woofer to the highest setting . This will set the internal low pass filter above the low pass filter frequency given by your receiver and create an LFE input . Or you may use a RCA cable to provide a connection to both inputs on the sub-woofer from the LR pre-out from the receiver . Then adjust the cross over frequency from the woofer as desired . It sounds a little louder and better for me . I bought Monster sub-woofer cable and it sounds no better than RCA cable . Try not to waste your money on this . It has 7.4 out of 10 in CNet rating and it is # 6 in editor \'s top list for sub-woofers . I matched PSW10 with R300 , RTi4 , R150 , CSi3 and Denon 1906 receiver . Mainly used for HDTV over the air , DVD movies and some FM . It sounds a lot better than the sub-woofer from RM6750 . It carries 5 years warranty but make sure you buy from Authorize dealer . For the price I paid I am more than happy with it . I hope this helps to your decision . ',normal

932,42_16_RPORPWO932O8R.txt,' I bought this before reading the reviews , which is unlike me . Once I saw the experiences the other buyers had had , I was nervous , but convinced myself that it would be fine . I run XP , so I downloaded the software from the Gravis site , installed everything , and tried a game . The D pad would n\'t work , despite the fact that I had downloaded the XP software . If this had been the only problem , I would have figured that I had just done something wrong , but the joysticks were awful ! Half the time , I would move the joystick up , to move forward , and when I released it my character kept going forward . Not great when you \'re standing on the edge of a cliff . I found it impossible to get any kind of control over my game characters , not nearly enough to even consider being able to use the gamepad for games . Another thing about the gamepad is that , although I tried it in the store , to get a feel for it , I decided rather quickly that , regardless of how it worked , it just was n\'t right for my small hands ( I \'m female , and have exceptionally small hands ) . I ca n\'t call this a complaint , just a matter of personal preference . When I viewed the `` Read Me \'\' file on this thing , and came to the section about `` Known Bugs \'\' , I about had a heart attack at all of the problems this thing is `` known \'\' to have !

Their solution ? `` Please wait a moment after each button click , to give the game time to respond \'\' . Erm , sure ; I \'ll just politely ask 200 Orcs to stop attacking me while Aragorn takes a moment to respond , no problem .

934,46_6_RVT096AILVPPW.txt,' Though I do not follow golf , it was hard not pay attention to Tiger . Naturally , I was left shaking my head with everyone else , wondering what drove someone so disciplined to make such a mess of his life . Steve Helling \'s book answers some of those questions , though it would be impossible to answer all of them . It is not a book of sensationalism or speculation , but well-written journalism that give us an inside look at both the life and the downfall of a paragon who never asked to be placed on the pedestal on which the world displayed him . This book follows the clues that tell us some of what makes Tiger Woods who he is , starting with the breadcrumbs that were dropped long before his birth . While a bemused public looked on as a toddler putted against Bob Hope , not one of them could have predicted that that same child would grow to be not only the world \'s greatest golfer , but also a hero and role model with such a carefully constructed persona that even his handlers would forget that a real person lay behind the smoke and mirrors . Tiger Woods was not a god , but an unforgiving public would punish him for not acting like one . While he is responsible for his mistakes , one ca n\'t help but wonder who Tiger would have been had he been allowed to be Tiger Woods rather than a meticulously crafted ideal . ',normal
935,30_13_R1EXPDBC1H528A.txt,' I do n\'t know anyone who loves Dick Morris . Some people hate him and can not hear anything he says . Just bringing up his name upsets them to the point of unreason . Yet , if one can simply consider what he has to say it is usually interesting and often worthwhile even if you strongly disagree with what he has to say . This is because he really does understand how our political emotions work and the kinds of issues that provoke the electorate to action . Whether or not he actually believes what he is saying on behalf of a politician or about an issue is not all that relevant . Personal convictions often wither under the hot sun of political campaigns . Even so , this book seems to be more about the frustrations Morris and McGann share with us about how both the Democrats and the Republicans are failing us in Congress . His take on the immigration problem is actually quite fresh . Rather than focusing only on the border with Mexico , he points out that at least half the problem , and the more serious failure in preventing another 9/11 , is the millions who overstay their visas . They come in legally , but fail to leave as required . Since we do not track who leaves the country it is all but impossible to find out who is here in violation of their visas ! Morris says that we not only need to begin tracking those who leave so we can get some idea who remains , but we also need to bar all immigration from those countries that are designated as sponsors and supporters of terror . The United Nations and its many failures and scandals are examined next . Morris and McGann show us why there is absolutely no motivation within the United Nations to behave well and how the organization \'s structure actually promotes human rights failures by putting the worst violators on the committees that are supposed to monitor and take action against situations such as Rwanda and Darfur . The authors also show us how Oil For Food was used by Saddam to not only line his own pockets at the expense of his people , but corrupted the political choices many of those nations who made our work in Iraq more difficult before the war , leading up to the war , during the war , and in helping Iraq build its own government . The efforts within the ACLU to suppress public criticism by its leaders of its leadership and policies are actually quite humorous and sad . It is hypocrisy of the first order and something more people need to be aware of when dealing with this organization that views itself as the final arbiter of our rights and social order . They need to be exposed more fully and we need organizations to resist and balance them more than we have now . Chapter four is the big biggest because it is where the authors expose the problems in Congress with travel , using family members to convert campaign contributions to cash , using family as lobbyists , and how little time they put in working on the people \'s business . Morris and McGann pull no punches and name names from both parties . This chapter alone makes reading this book worthwhile . However upset with Congress you are now , you will be more angry after reading and thinking about the facts presented here . We also get chapters on how the Patriot Act and the NSA `` wiretapping \'\' ( actually data mining ) have helped in the War on Terror , how the teacher unions are actually hurting our efforts to educate our children ( not the teachers - the UNIONS ) , how big pharma is spending huge money on Congress to keep their billions in profits flowing in , and how Fannie Mae is misusing its mandate and money to support many Democrat causes . Morris and McGann then do an excellent job in going after the Republicans for the bankruptcy bill that prevents people such as those suffering from cancer and oceans of medical bills from getting a fresh start . The credit companies also basically shove credit on people they know should n\'t have it and then want to avoid the risks of these bad business practices and keep these folks more or less permanently enslaved to them . The authors also go after the terrible changes Congress made to the student loan programs . We also get information about how insurance companies are trying to get out of the hurricane Katrina claims by saying they would pay for wind damage , but not water damage . Right . How do you get a hurricane without water damage ? I have been in a hurricane . The water is a fundamental part of the storm . Why should we allow them to get away with this ? We also get a chapter on how some tobacco companies , even after all the bad exposure and supposed settlements and public humiliation are STILL raising the nicotine levels in their cigarettes . There is also a chapter on how Gerhard Schroeder and Jacques Chirac have acted in quite corrupt ways . The final chapter is how Congress yields to special interests and trade protections in the name of saving jobs . These saved jobs cost us many hundreds of thousands of dollars each . And they also drive industries out of the country . For example , any number of candy companies have moved production to Canada and elsewhere so they can buy sugar at the world price and remain competitive rather than keeping the plants and jobs in the U.S. and paying more than twice the world price for sugar . This book should tap into the current disgust the majority of Americans rightly feel for Congress . We should be rotating even more of them out in 2008 and hope the material here gets people motivated to do just that . ',normal

1200,5_4_R3RXBM0S6DS2ES.txt,' & quot ; The Sun also Rises & quot ; made a huge impression on me when I read it as a college student a number of years ago . It is true that one must look beyond the surface to get a clear understanding of any book by Hemingway . It is also true that the language that he used was not flowery , nor overly eloquent but the meaning revealed within the lines . It is also true that the characters are often expatriates ; living on the fringe of society and hedonistic to the max . All of those elements are visible here , yet sometimes it might require a magnifying glass to see it . However , these are the qualities which make Ernest Hemingway , the seminal writer for a generation and certainly one of the best . I propose one hint when reading & quot ; the Sun also Rises. & quot ; Pay close attention to the relationship between Barnes and Robert Cohn . Barnes laothes Cohn for being everything that he is not . What drives him over the edge ( in the inner sanctum of his own mind and demons ) is the success Cohn has insofar as his relationship with Lady Brett . Barnes is impotent and this is a crushing blow to his manhood . The tragedy here is his inability to consummate a sexual relationship with her . It destroys him -- yet he is still accepting of his predicament . This is what allows this character to maintain & quot ; grace under pressure & quot ; -- as Hemingway once coined the term or the ability to stand or hold ones ground when all odds are against you . Certainly this can be a tragic flaw for any of Hemingway \'s male characters -- the total loss of his virility . Yet he stands his ground and never loses it . He just hates Cohn from a distance and rationalizes that he ( Cohn ) is one who can not do anything just for the sake of doing it -- -whether it be drinking , winning the Princeton boxing title , or being in love with Brett . It is complicated but one can come away with these qualities after finishing the novel rather than while reading it . I think his friend and sometimes rival , F. Scott Fitzgerald , summed him up best when he said of Hemingway : & quot ; He \'s the real thing. & quot ; ',normal

1187,40_11_R3A24SMOJBHDCA.txt,' My wife and I just went to a double-feature . I picked AVATAR and she picked THE BLIND SIDE . Now , there could n\'t be two movies on a different plateau than AVATAR and BLIND SIDE , but I \'m so glad that she brought me to see this movie . AVATAR , I gave 4 stars , BLIND SIDE , 5 stars . BLIND SIDE , for what it was , was flawless . With BLIND SIDE , the story tells itself , because it \'s the true story of 2009 Baltimore Ravens Right Tackle Michael Oher , or possibly Michael Williams , or maybe something else , and his improbable escape from oblivion with the love and care of a rich white family in Memphis , Tennessee . Michael Oher \'s greatness , first showed up in his size and athletic potential and then in his courage to forget and go forward . Michael Oher , a kid who struggled at basic study skills and education , but scored a 98 \% in protective instincts . A tribute to his lifestyle and his ability to survive , homeless , with two shirts , a pain on his face that could n\'t be explained . Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy , and I have n\'t seen a whole lot of nominated movies this year , but if she is n\'t at least a runner up to the best actress of the year , I \'ll be stunned . This was Sandra Bullock \'s shining moment . She is strong and she is funny and she is exceedingly brilliant at hiding the tears she sheds throughout the movie as her personna wo n\'t allow her to be seen crying . No scene was more poigniant than the one where she makes a bedroom for Michael in her beautiful home with a chipperness that you would expect from a spunky Tennessee mother . Michael says , `` I \'ve never had one of these before . \'\' and she says , `` What , a room ? \'\' `` No , a bed . \'\' he says . She looks at him , stoned faced , gives a quick nod and exits the room , enters the bathroom , locks the door and although we do n\'t see it , we know exactly what she \'s doing . THE BLIND SIDE is a testimant to what life is all about . The Tuohy families link to Michael Oher may have been a rare occurence , and that \'s why there \'s a movie about it , but if we all looked out for each other a little more , despite color boundaries , despite class boundaries and just showed a little love and extended a helping hand when we could , the world would be a better place .

942,21_10_R4DHZNZKG5S1A.txt,' Bioware has a pretty impressive track record for RPGs . Their most famous work to date , Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic , garnered almost every `` Game of the Year \'\' award in the video game industry back when it was released . Now a few years later , we get \'Mass Effect \' . A Sci-Fi adventure that at times can seem as if it has endless choices for you to make . A few examples are things such as your character customization options ( including gender and specializations ) , weapon and armor customization , and your `` good or evil \'\' path choices . Actually , boiling it down to Good or Evil is a mistatement . It is n\'t that simple with Mass Effect . You are set out to be a \'hero \' , but how you get there is your choice . You can choose to work with the citizens you encounter to get complete your mission and be a Paragon . You can also choose to be a take-no-prisoners type of character and be a Renegade . If neither of those suit you , play it right down the middle a be a balance of both or neither . Your choice . The story is Bioware \'s best plot ever . If you played the original Knights of the Old Republic , that \'s saying something . I wo n\'t give anything away , because the story is one of the main selling points of the game . The combat is simple . In fact , some might find it overly so . However , I think people are missing the point . This is n\'t trying to be the greatest Third Person Shooter ever created . It \'s trying to revolutionize what RPGs can be . The graphics are beyond stunning . Sometimes you will find yourself staring at your surrondings in awe and completely forget what you were doing . There is a minor buffering issue where all of the textures are loaded a second or two after you regain control of your characters , but it \'s nothing that really detracts from the games overall beauty . In my opinion , I think Bioware succeeded in once again showing us the true potential of what the RPG genre can put forth . In fact , if there is one RPG out this year that is a must have , Mass Effect is it . Do not hesitate to order because you wo n\'t regret the purchase . ',normal

Alt-G refresh of the screen restored the text temporarily but further sun exposure resulted in screen fading . This is not a problem with the Kindle 1 . Ever since I got the Kindle 2 , its text has been lighter than my K1 , but not so much that I could n\'t tolerate it The fading in sunlight makes the text virtually unreadable .

Needless to say , I am a very unhappy camper . If replacing my current K2 will not fix the problem , then that means that a ) they have not identified the source of the problem and b ) that any K2 currently purchased will have a similarly defective screen .

957,25_14_R167OPY31FJFQR.txt,' In 2000 , a Baltimore newspaper ran a story with the headline , `` Local Graduate Named Rhodes Scholar . \'\' It was a story about the author , Wes Moore , a young black man who rose from the drug , crime and poverty-stricken streets of the city to attain this prestigious academic honor . Several months earlier , in the same paper , Mr. Moore had noticed a series of articles about two young black men who killed a Baltimore policeman while robbing a jewelry store . The name of one of the killers struck him : his name was Wes Moore . This coincidence prompts the author to seek out `` the other Wes Moore . \'\' He contacts Wes in prison . `` How did this happen ? \'\' he asks . The question jumpstarts the story of these two young men whose life paths diverged , one into triumph , the other into tragedy . The author comes to realize that this seemingly complicated story , a too-familiar story that is freighted with societal , economic and racial impact , comes down to a few simple moments in time . `` These forks in the road can happen so fast for young boys , \'\' he says . `` Within months or even weeks , their journeys can take a decisive and possibly irrevocable turn . \'\' I would more specifically pin the divergence on the boys \' mothers . The author is born into a two-parent home , both parents college educated , but his father dies when Wes is just three . His mother moves to the Bronx , so that her parents can help provide a stable home life . She works multiple jobs so that she can put her boys in private school . When the author starts to feel the pull of the streets , she packs him off to military school . The other Wes Moore grows up in a single-parent household of starkly different character . His father is absent and his mother frequently dumps him on friends and family so she can go out clubbing . Although she \'d been attending community college , she loses her Pell Grant and simply gives up . Disagreements in the home are handled with beatings . The older brother gets into the drug trade , and all three of them , mother and two sons , bring babies into the world without the stability of marriage . It \'s no surprise when the other Wes Moore \'s run-ins with the law begin . This is a compelling story told with passion and understanding . While the author is compassionate , he also makes clear that he is in no way excusing the other Wes Moore for his heinous deed . Even so , I imagine this is a tough book for the family of the slain policeman to read .

I think she makes some good points , and I think some things are just put out there and that she does n\'t listen . She just wants only her opinion to be right to an extreme . She \'s good at analyzing situations , but she would not be good for a government position requiring much trust to keep stability , that is for sure . On the other hand , you probably want her to be your Republican lobbyist . A `` friend \'\' a `` Coulter Jr. \'\' told me about how great this book is . He acts just like Coulter , but just does n\'t publish books and goes out and speaks like she does . Otherwise , he would probably be doing at least okay- ( Coulter created and kept her niche first . ) I am not particularly Democrat or Republican , but I try to give everything a chance . This book , while giving some fresh perspectives I would not have thought of , is quite hit or miss , too opinionated , and not always reasoning things out enough . ',normal

I \'m happy to report that the picture and sound quality of Netflix downloads is very good on the PS3 . Much faster and better than I expected . Not hi-def , but better than regular TV . And I have the Blu-Ray to watch movies by mail from Netflix at the highest quality . Blu-Ray really is an awesome experience if you have a big HDTV and a surround sound system . I use the Sony CT-500 sound bar and subwoofer that has amazing sound quality and separation . Sony markets the PS3 as an `` entertainment system \'\' and I agree that it serves this function very well for me . I returned my hi-def cable boxes to Cox and am now saving $ 65 per month that was being wasted on crummy channels with endless commercials that I never watched .

963,33_8_RB4OFYY55W2KV.txt,' Like many fans out there , you \'re probably wondering what in the world the 1.11 rebuild of Evangelion is considering the 1.01 release is barely four months old . While FUNimation has confirmed that 1.01 was the beginning of four rebuilt feature film releases , 1.11 is n\'t the second one but rather 1.01 again with some of its lighting ( lack thereof ) issues addressed , the addition of 2-minutes of new scenes and a second disc including a bunch of extra material . Hard facts first : The release is comprised of a two-disc set , with the feature presentation now coming in at comes in at 100-minutes with an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action , violence and some ambiguous nudity . Language options are standard sub & dub fair , which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub , either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound . The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well . Extras are quite robust and occupy the entire second disc . Included : Rebuild of Evangelion : 1.01 ( Shiro Sagisu Version , Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version ) , `` Angel of Doom \'\' Promotional Music Video , News Flashes , Movie Previews : Preview 1 - Color-corrected version , Beautiful World Version 2 , Beautiful World Version 2A , and Beautiful World Version 2B . The story , while straightforward enough in presentation , has been the source of case studies , web-site devotion , even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately ( with dignity ) here . However , to reduce it all down to its most basic levels , a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking `` Angel \'\' comes to town . It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions . Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process . Working for a top-secret , underground ( literally ) organization known as NERV , Shingi \'s life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom . So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens , you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here . The answer is a bit complex , but I \'ll do my best to set it straight . Way back in October of 1995 , the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan . Two years later the work was `` rebuilt \'\' into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger , single effort . The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise , the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time was n\'t quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually . Hence in 2007 , the material was revisited once more , this time not simply remastering from the original film stock , but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film . It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material . As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was , at the time , quite impossible to achieve . Hence that brings us back to this , the 1.11 release , which is the second official North American release of this rebuilt movie series ( it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total , with the third and fourth parts being released together ) . Obviously , part 1.11 represents the introduction to the story . If the timeline appears confusing , rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film . It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear . Plot wise , the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment . Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji . Fans , detractors , and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion \'s symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction . In fact , it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film ( which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series ) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion . The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity \'s savior , the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces , the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions , the impassive corporation behind it all , and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence . Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed . The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals . The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track ( which is spectacular by the way ) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation \'s finest performers . Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work . In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time . The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process . Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology \'s capabilities . Considering the asking price of the new build is n\'t much higher than the extra-feature-less 1.01 release , this is the recommended choice . ',normal

My boyfriend \'s 12-year-old son got quickly frustrated with the obstacle course , but I bet he \'d be a natural at skateboarding . You just have to find what works for you . Fortunately there are plenty of choices ! Another fun feature is that you feel like you \'re working out with your friends and family .

They cheer you on at the finish line , demonstrate the moves , toss you your hula hoops , march in your band , etc. , and your pet can run along side you as you cycle . It can be an added little boost to your workout . Wii Fit Plus also keeps track of your best times/scores , so it \'s fun to be able to challenge your previous records . It always feel great when you beat your previous best . The yoga is good if you like a more calm , relaxed type of workout .

A very important one that happens to store all of my gear . Guess what ? There \'s no way to undo that . Now he just attacks me any time I get near him . Sure , I could kill him , but I would not be able to store my gear or retrieve my stored gear . You get to either A . Start your game completely over , or B. try to beat the game with the weight on your back . Either way this was an EXTREME annoyance to me . I already had about 18-20 hours invested when this happened and I basically got to watch all that effort go up in smoke . Would this game be more fun if this was n\'t a problem ? Sure . 2 . There is not a lot of loot . The reward structure in this game is flawed . You \'ll go hours without finding anything you want to use , unless you can somehow decipher the wiki information out there and hunt down the treasure -- if you can get to it . There are about 15 swords in the entire game . Oh , yeah , you can upgrade your weaponry if you feel like farming the stones . That \'s about all the variation you will get out of this game . 3 . The coop system sucks . Plain and simple . It either wo n\'t load sometimes or you \'ll be baffled as to how it actually works . I do n\'t want to study a manual or search google to play with my friends . 4 . You \'ll farm endlessly to level your character . You \'ll probably mess your build up . You \'ll get to start over again to get the right build if you care anything about this game . I do n\'t care , so I \'m definitely not starting over . My build was pretty good anyway . 5 . Finally , you \'ll die . You \'ll die quite a bit . You \'ll die after spending a half an hour trying to get to a boss only to start over again . This , again , is part of the reward structure that is completely flawed . 6 . You can only equip things up to half your total weight capacity . On top of that , you have to have the endurance necessary to have `` equip capacity \'\' outside of that . So not only can you not equip anything you want up to your total weight , but you have to invest in separate branches to do it . It \'s similar to the magic side of things , too . You have to level your intelligence for your mana or mp , and you have to level your magic for the magic power . Then there is also faith magic , which is a completely different set .

977,30_3_RYZJTDPYNWFB7.txt,' I have had the Samsung BD-C5500 Blu-ray player for about a week now and I absolutely love it . It was very easy to setup and worked perfectly right out of the box . It \'s smaller in size than the DVD player it is replacing but noticeably heavier . It starts up quickly and loads Blu-ray discs quickly too . The buttons on the front of the player are touch sensitive and do n\'t give the user any tactile feedback so sometimes it \'s hard to tell if you have pushed them or not but at the same time they are cool and have a cutting-edge appeal . Some people have mentioned that they do n\'t care for the remote but I find it to be very adequate and easy to use . I like the larger size of the buttons since I have big hands . The remote seems to work well at different angles and distances as well . When I first hooked up the player it did a firmware update and about a week later it notified me that there was a newer firmware and again did an update . It \'s comforting to see that Samsung is actively working to improve the device \'s firmware by releasing updates frequently if needed . I did n\'t know what issues/features the firmware updates were addressing because the UI on the player does n\'t really tell you but Samsung does list what the firmware updates change/fix on their website . The device did n\'t have any problems connecting to my home network using a CAT-5 cable . It does n\'t bother me a bit that this player does n\'t support wi-fi out of the box . In my experience wi-fi is very susceptible to interference from other devices such as microwaves , cordless phones , and other wi-fi routers so using it to stream a high-definition movie could be problematic when you decide to pop some popcorn during the show or if someone calls you on your cordless phone . You \'ll always get better streaming performance from CAT-5 . Plus , it \'s a lot cheaper than the players that do have wi-fi built in . I have used this player to stream Netflix content from my Netflix instant queue . Before having this player we watched a lot of Netflix streaming content on our computer but watching it on the HDTV using this player has been a lot more convenient and sounds better on the home audio system than on the computer speakers . Streaming works very well and I have n\'t seen it skip frames or stop to re-buffer the stream . It takes a little longer to buffer the stream at the beginning of playback than my computer does but after a 15-20 second wait it \'s good to go so it \'s not a big deal . I have spoken with people who stream Netflix through the PS3 or XBOX and they have told me it takes about the same amount of time to buffer on those systems and I would imagine other Blu-ray players that stream Netflix would have similar performance . Some of the Netflix streaming content will stream in 720p resolution which looks and sounds great . One thing to note is that this player will only see titles you have added to your Instant Queue on the Netflix website . You can not use the player to browse for different content and add it to your queue . This has not been very bothersome to me but it might bother some people . I actually like the fact that I can put titles in the Instant Queue for my children to watch and they ca n\'t browse around Netflix on the player and find adult content accidentally in the process . Streaming music through Pandora has been great too . The Pandora app works well and has a good interface . You can give songs a thumbs up or thumbs down but only while the song is playing . It would be great if you could go back through the list of songs that have recently played and give them the thumbs up or thumbs down after they have played like you can on the Pandora website but that \'s not the way it works sadly . The quality of the audio seems very good and the time it takes to buffer the music is not even noticeable . We have really enjoyed having a device capable of using Pandora connected to the home audio/theater system . I used the Blockbuster service to rent a movie for my kids . The video/audio quality was excellent and I had no streaming problems but the price was a little absurd . The movies cost about $ 4 to rent and you only have access to watch the movie for 24 hours from the time you first start playing it . At that price I would expect that you would get to watch the title as much as you want for 5 days just like you would do if you physically rented a movie from a Blockbuster location . I do n\'t think I will be using the Blockbuster service very much unless there is a movie I really want to watch and I \'m too tired/lazy to physically go to a Blockbuster and rent it . Overall I feel like the device does a lot for how much I paid for it and is definitely worth the money . I have already recommended it to numerous friends and co-workers who have been looking to get a Blu-ray player . This is the first Blu-ray player I have owned and might possibly be the last since it \'s so feature-rich and works so well . Update 4/14/2010 : I have had this player for over a month now and I have received 4 firmware updates I think . With the firmware updates the device has only gotten better . The updates did n\'t appear to add any new features but they have made the player more stable so it is less likely to freeze-up or stop working in other ways . Everything has been working flawlessly for me . There is a new service called Vudu now that this player supports . I have not tried to use it yet but it appears to give you one free HD rental so that you can try the service . It looks similar to the Blockbuster streaming app . Most movies appear to have options to rent/buy the title in 3 different formats . HDX ( 1080p 5.1 Surround ) , HD ( 720p 5.1 Surround ? ) , and SD ( Standard Definition 480p and I \'m not sure on the audio ) . I have watched a few trailers on Vudu and they stream fine but I have n\'t tried actually streaming a movie from Vudu yet . ',normal

981,33_7_R3UD81ZBTIW5GQ.txt,' When I saw this item for sale I just had to buy one for my husband as a college graduation gift . Margaritas are his favorite drink and he just could n\'t duplicate that restaurant quality consistancy with a blender . This Margaritaville machine actually shaves the ice instead of chopping it like a blender would do . This creates that nice smooth consistancy of the drink instead of a lumpy texture . It \'s very easy to operate . All you do is fill the ice chamber with ice , pour the correct amout of your drink mixture into the pitcher ( it will make 1-3 servings at a time ) , set the machine to how many servings you would like , then turn it on . The machine automatically measure , shaves and blend the perfect amount of ice according to the amount of servings . No more watery drinks . When my kids have friends over for pool parties they love me to make them alcohol free strawberry daiquiris or pina coladas or fruit smoothies . One nice feature about this machine is that as the ice in the ice chamber melts , the water is channeled into a collection reservoir , that is easily removeable to dump out . The water never mixes with the drink mix . Clean-up is simple . Whatever ice remains in the ice chamber can be left to melt and drain into the reservoir then discard it or you can have the machine shave the remaining ice into the pitcher . We put our pitcher and pitcher parts into the dishwasher for a good cleaning . If you are a frozen drink lover , like my husband and I are you have to own one of these . It \'s pricey but worth it ! I also , highly recommend the canvas carrying case that can be purchased separately . It \'s very nicely made . ',normal
982,28_18_R1ZDWC7Y3FLMWO.txt,' Janet Evanovich has cranked out 15 great Stephanie Plum novels , and if she \'s tired of doing it , that \'s her right . Thanks for the 15 great reads . But whoever thought they could keep a lucrative series going strong by finding someone else to write number 16 was sorely mistaken - because , as noted , you ca n\'t duplicate effervescence . Yes , the author has read all the other books . Me , too . Yes , the author knows that Stephanie is torn between two hotties . I got that , too . Yes , the author knows to include wacky characters and purportedly amusing scenarios . But being able to write IN THE STYLE of Janet Evanovich is not the same thing as BEING Janet Evanovich . I can write in the style of Mark Twain or Charles Dickens ; it \'s just not going to be any good . Sizzling Sixteen falls as flat as Granny Mazur in an orthopedic boot . Do n\'t be fooled by the name on the cover ; this is n\'t Our Girl . Only question now is - do we trust that Janet will be back for # 17 , horrified by the literary crime committed under her name ? Or is it time to give up hope and lose ourselves in earlier volumes , enjoying Stephanie at her best and not subjecting ourselves to the pain of what must surely be ham-fisted fan fiction in print ?

983,10_3_RHM6KF5MZYMUF.txt,' If you spend much time driving in unfamiliar territory , especially if you rent cars in big cities , a good portable GPS makes an amazing difference . And the Garmin 255W is the best one I could find in the $ 250 - $ 350 range . First this thing just plain works . I have n\'t had any issues with mine . It was easy to set up and figure out right out of the box , and it \'s easy to use . It never has had trouble getting sufficient signal unlike earlier and cheaper models . I chose the 255W for several reasons : It uses some of the newest and best maps available . It has one of the more usable touch screens for entering destinations . It \'s fast to acquire satellites . And Garmin almost always comes out on top in reviews -- especially in routing . Ultimately , you buy a car GPS to get you from Point A to Point B as easily and efficiently as possible . And that \'s what the 255W does best . If you \'ve ever had a `` Brand X \'\' GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip , has you turn the wrong way down a one way road , tell you to turn AFTER you \'ve passed the street , frequently loses the satellite signal , or has old maps missing streets , you know how important this stuff is . The 255W has a really clear display that \'s easy to see in any light . It \'s small enough to use on foot . The windshield mount works great and it \'s easy to toss in the glovebox when you park . It even tells you the speed limit on most roads . The `` points of interest \'\' feature works very well to find places to eat by type of cuisine , gas stations , etc . The difference between the 255W and 205W is the 255 speaks street names and includes Alaska and Canada . The 205 and 205W will tell you to `` turn right in 500 feet \'\' which is n\'t as helpful or obvious as `` turn right on Ivy Street in 500 feet \'\' . The `` W \'\' models are widescreen which makes entering destinations easier due to having a bigger `` keyboard \'\' and also lets you see more map area while driving . All in all this is n\'t the cheapest GPS in its class but it \'s one of the best . My only gripe is you need an expensive add-on to get live traffic data -- something that \'s included with the Magellan Roadmate 1430 which is close to the same price . But the Garmin 255W is a better GPS in every other way . ',normal

986,22_5_RRNJ2C31OG3N7.txt,' I have been a great fan of Laurell Hamilton . I greatly admire her writing ability and imagination . And her daring as well , she is willing to confront unusual sexual issues in a genre where sexuality is more often a matter of hints and gestures . Struck by the intensity of the sexual focus in her recent work I thought it would be entertaining to go back and reread some of Hamilton \'s earlier books . `` Guilty Pleasures \'\' is the first of the Anita Blake series . What makes the series unique is the strong , tough-minded character of the heroine and narrator . Before `` Guilty Pleasures \'\' vampire stories rarely had female leads , let alone one with the hard-nosed style of Anita Blake . She is a professional animator ( one who raises the dead ) and a licensed vampire killer in an alternate earth where vampires have come out of the closet ( coffin ? ) and are active participants in American life . Hamilton \'s vampires are of the Anne Rice genre . They are beautiful , deadly and follow their own code of ethics . Many humans have become enthralled with them , but many are deeply suspicious . To Anita they are monsters who , when they go out of control , must be killed . But U.S. law protects vampires that behave themselves . Even so , when someone starts killing the vampires of St. Louis , authorities make little progress . Angered , two of the strongest vampires in the city , Jean-Claude and Nikolaos , convince Anita to hunt down the killer . Jean-Claude is one of the modern romantic vampires , easy to look at with fine manners and style . Nikolaos , on the other hand , is a thousand year old sadistic horror in the body of a thirteen year old girl . Her powers are unimaginable and dark hungers hide under her innocent looks . The vampiress takes an immediate dislike to Anita \'s feisty style and our heroine spends as much time dodging Nikolaos \' efforts to injure and enslave her as she does seeking the killer . Jean-Claude comes under attack as well as he tries to help Anita . Hamilton \'s way with characters is one of her great strengths . We meet several of Anita \'s regular companions for the first time . Edward the hyper-violent bounty hunter , and Veronica , a private investigator and friend are outstanding , as are many of the bit players . Her vampires and their human servants are vivid personalities . This gives the novel a realistic feel that comes as a surprise in the vampire genre . The plot is fast paced , often moving from cliff-hanger to horrific confrontation with all the agility of the ball in a pinball game . There is a steady sexual undercurrent that veers towards sadistic and fetish oriented pleasures . It is a natural outgrowth of the vampire personality and is as chilling as it is erotic . In `` Guilty Pleasures \'\' it is an effective plot device that keeps the heat turned up . If you are a vampire story fan you will find Laurell Hamilton \'s efforts deeply satisfying . ',normal

Such comical propoganda devices that resembled those used in the 1950s , only instead of targeting communism they target american business . The lies in this film were so blatant that i felt like i was watching MSNBC or Fox . As a third generation cuban , my great grandmother was cubano , it was rather insulting to show cuba as this garden of eden for equality and freedom.But i eventually got over this because you cant let blatant lies and propoganda get you down otherwise the bullies in our culture like Mr. Moore win . If there is anyone that actually believes that Cuba has an admirable , free , health care system let me state some facts gathered from actuall cuban doctors and patients who managed to escape . -IF there is a complication with the fetus of a pregnant woman the government forces an abortion . -If a child dies soon after birth the doctor will not record it as ever having lived at all ( remember when moore stated that cuba enjoys a lower infant mortality rate ? well there you go . thats the reason . ) -That UN survey that states cuba as having a better health care system than us is on the survey , however the UN does not investigate countrie \'s health care systems , they simply take down whatever the country decides to report . Hmmmm .... why should we believe what a communist dictator has to say about his own country ? -Smuggled pictures show dilapidated hospitals , patients who are dying of starvation , neglect , and infection .

Why is it that in this country people will pay $ 6 for a cup of coffee , and $ 50 for a videogame , but when it comes to their healthcare its simply `` too expensive \'\' and somehow the fault of `` greedy businessmen \'\' .

1100,35_9_R2TDCMV16FIQLI.txt,' Despite heartrending descriptions of sexual abuse , racism , poverty , homeless and much , much , more in modern India , this is an utterly enjoyable picaresque adventure that is one of the best reads of the year . In the hands of another author , the brief life story Ram Mohammad Thomas would probably be told as a simple tearjerker tragedy and the reader would be left to shake their head sorrowfully at the plight of another poor third-world soul . However , Swarup has a gimmick framework up his sleeve , and it works like a charm . Granted , one has to be willing to go along with the premise that this entire structure is based on coincidence of colossal proportions -- readers who are n\'t willing to suspend disbelief will probably not last more than a few chapters . We first meet the 18-year-old protagonist in jail , where he sits accused of defrauding the popular TV game show `` Who Wants to Be A Billionaire ? \'\' ( in rupees ) . Despite being abandoned at birth , uneducated , and left to fend for himself for most of his life , it seems Ram somehow managed to answer the show \'s twelve questions correctly . To all outside observers , his social standing and lack of education appear to preclude this happening legitimately . However , just as the police are about to unleash some heavy manners on him , a mysterious lawyer intervenes and takes him away . The story then unfolds question by question , as Ram tells her via flashbacks to his life just how he managed to know each answer . Ram \'s life story unfolds as a series of episodes ranging from the horrific to the merely tragicomic , and in a sense , one can view him as emblematic of India \'s lost children , and the book as caustic social commentary on contemporary India . Aside from being abandoned at birth , he must contend with a pedophile priest , a closeted homosexual movie star , a violent , drunken neighbor bent on incest , international espionage , child slavery , numerous thieves , a suicidal employer , and the deaths of several close friends . And yet , despite this bleak subject matter , the intrepid Ram keeps doggedly moving forward and surviving . This is n\'t done in a sentimental , `` triumph of the human sprit \'\' , after-school special way , but in a straightforward manner that shows a confused young boy doing whatever it takes to live . And of course , the ultimate moral of the story is that those who keep their eyes and ears open in life can learn a lot about it without any books .

1007,17_6_R3378SCLJAR1XA.txt,' This book was highly recommended by a fellow Amazon reviewer whose tastes mirror my own . Not only did she give it an excellent review , when we spoke she sang its praises . So , I went and bought the book . After all , I had read books by Anne Rice , as well as Donna Boyd , and enjoyed them . So , obviously books about vampires and/or lycanthropes are hardly a stretch for me . To my surprise , I was hooked once I began turning the pages of this book . It is a totally fun book to read , with its diminutive , feisty heroin , Anita Blake , a formidable vampire hunter who now focuses on being an animator , one who raises the dead . She lives in an alternate America where vampirism is legal , and vampires of the world are flocking to our shores . In good old St. Louis , Missouri , where our intrepid heroine lives , vampires live openly among humans and have developed a bizarre cult following . Of course , since killing vampires is against the law , Anita works closely with the police supernatural squad . Someone , however , is killing vampires , and although the police is investigating , the most powerful vampire in the city , Nicholaos , a thousand year old being who is ensconced in the body of a beautiful pubescent girl , has commissioned her to find the killer . The reluctant Anita , who finds herself at odds with evil Nicholaos , finds an unexpected ally and friend in the handsome Jean-Claude , a two centuries old vampire for whom she feels an unexpected attraction and affinity . Anita finds herself in a number of hair-raising situations as she seeks to discover the killer . Along the way she is plagued by vampires , wererats , ghouls , other animators , and fellow humans . The plot is fast-paced and intriguing . Its characters capture the reader \'s imagination . While most of them are not particularly well-fleshed , as it is basically a plot driven book , the main character , Anita Blake , is quite interesting , as well as compelling , and resonates with the reader . The author manages to pull together a highly entertaining and enjoyable book . The style is part detective potboiler , part mystery , and part fantasy with supernatural portents . It carries the reader along from its first page to its last , never losing its momentum . In fact , it leaves the reader wanting more . Good thing that this is merely the first in a series of books about this intrepid vampire hunter , Anita Blake . I look forward to reading them all . ',normal
1008,20_8_RJS4C378L3XLD.txt,' Just received my new Aria last night . This is my first ever Android phone - Full Disclosure : I am coming from an old Blackberry & Moto Slvr so I am not exactly on the bleeding edge of smartphone development . My initial impression after about 4 hours of use is - fantastic phone ! Things did not get off to a good start however when I could n\'t get the phone apart to put the battery and SIM card in . I found the trick was to put my fingernail into the slot where you are supposed to split the phone apart and slide it to the left and right to get the top catches to release - others have said pushing the front out by pressing on the speakerphone in back while also using the slot works but I was hesitant to do that . The size and weight are perfect for my needs as I did n\'t want something the size of the Spring Evo 4G , etc . Although the big displays on that phone and similar phones are great I just felt they were too big for my daily use ( and I had to stay on AT & T ) . The upside is with the resolution on this screen on a physically smaller screen than say my son \'s iPhone 3G the `` crispness \'\' of the display ( especially text ) is super . Physically the phone feels fantastic in hand and the build quality is excellent . Regarding the two primary AT & T induced drawbacks ... no sideloading and AT & T bloatware : for the average user those are probably minor to non-issues . There are workarounds for both issues - the phone has already been rooted ( check any of the Android developer forms ) and custom ROMs are even available with the AT & T `` features \'\' removed . I was going to wait a few more weeks to let the hardware gurus fully explore the phone before making any modifications - but I really want that Swype keyboard . After a look at some of the AT & T software I think I might have to agree with some of the conspiracy crowd that AT & T would rather not be forced to deal with Android . Initial opening of the AT & T Hotspot app and the page is not centered ? ? Come on AT & T - at least make it look like you are trying ! Sorry - I have been ticked off with AT & T from day one with regard to Android as I never understood how it was in their interest to NOT sell a phone that their customers want given the REAL revenue is in the two year data agreement - not the hardware . Lots more to explore but I do n\'t think you will be disappointed with the Aria ( especially at Amazon \'s price ) if you decide to purchase one . ',normal

1014,2_13_R23CV1SFGOT7Y6.txt,' While I understand the excitement over the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt , Available in Various Sizes , I must politely disagree with the furor over that particular garment . At first I agreed with the hundreds of reviews of that other shirt . It arrived in the mail , I tried it on , and my cat fought me to the death , small woodland animals prostrated themselves at my feet and offered themselves as sacrifices , and human women ovulated at the sight of me . I was an instant fan , and I knew I would never need another wolf shirt made by The Mountain company . Then I decided I wanted a t-shirt celebrating the life and times of the musician Howlin \' Wolf . My dial-up internet connection was taking too long to load the pictures for this shirt so I ordered it based on the name alone . When it arrived I was at first furious . How dare The Mountain manufacture a shirt with a title that so closely resembles the name of such a legendary bluesman ? Their sheer audacity had me pondering a very sternly-worded letter to their Wolf Shirt Department , let me tell you . But after I broke down and tried on this Howling Wolf T-shirt , all thoughts of letter-writing left me , and I never again wore the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt . It now lies at the bottom of a mountain of detritus in my closet , never to see the light of day ( or moonlight of night ) again . The Howling Wolf T-shirt by The Mountain ( 100 \% Cotton Short Sleeve , fits Kids , Teens & Adults ) is by far the superior t-shirt . It is , however , not for the weak or for the superficial fan of The Mountain \'s wolf t-shirt line . While the Three Wolf Moon shirt gives the viewer and wearer a sense of community , Howling Wolf T-shirt is for the true loner . It \'s for the outcasts in our society , it \'s for every man or woman who ever looked into that vast night sky and realized nobody else was by their side to howl along with them . The moment I donned this shirt , an overwhelming sense of angst gripped me like an existential vise . I tore the sleeves off my jean jacket without thinking and I found myself outside the house wearing a red bandana . My wife and children were nowhere to be found , as each time I wear this t-shirt I am transported to a world where I have no one to rely on but myself . I drove around for hours listening to the Smiths and the Cure , sobbing uncontrollably , but each tear drop was instantly absorbed by the shirt surrounding my torso and they seemed to make the image shine that much brighter . I found myself in mountainous terrain with a few trees , very much like the biome depicted on the shirt itself . Was it alpine ? Taiga ? I will never know for sure , but once I pulled over and stepped out of the car all thoughts of terrain descriptors vanished and I was drawn to a steep cliff overlooking a valley . The moon shone high above , full and round , and I was suddenly aware that a change had taken me over . I was faster , stronger , and my senses were more acute . Do n\'t believe the hype surrounding the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt when people claim it transformed them into wolves themselves . I wore it and that never happened . The Howling Wolf T-shirt , on the other hand , transmogrified me into canis lupus and I could no more stop myself from howling at that moon than I could grip a pencil ( as a wolf I no longer had opposable thumbs ) . Alone , I thought vaguely . I am alone . This world holds nothing and no one for me . I shall forevermore walk the night on my own , killing to live . Then , as if in answer , the moon vanished behind a cloud . A soft voice spoke behind me . `` You shall never walk alone . \'\' It all seems a bit like a Green Day lyric when I describe it here , but it was profound beyond mere words . Standing before me was a woman cloaked in translucent white garments that revealed the feminine curves of her ample-bosomed frame . She looked at me with benevolence and love , and suddenly I was aware that my moroseness and ennui had left me at last . My soul flew free into the night above that valley . We came together in an embrace for the ages , as the stars made cascading patterns , singing sweetly in voices no man will ever hear unless he wears this particular shirt , and even then perhaps only in size L. Finally , in a moment of cosmic kismet , the moon goddess Luna whispered in my ear a lyric from Howlin \' Wolf himself : `` You know I called you darling to come back to the Wolf / But I \'ll be around , yes I \'ll be around / To see what you \'re puttin \' down \'\' . With that , the light from both moon and stars winked out , and I slipped from consciousness . I found myself lying on that rocky outcropping the next morning . The Howling Wolf T-shirt was lying next to me along with the rest of my clothes . Carefully avoiding any skin-to-skin contact with the garment , I carried it to the car and put it in the back seat . Later , back at my house , I placed it safely in a Rubbermaid container ( also available here on Amazon ) and admired my taut frame in the mirror . Gone were the sagging lines of middle age , the liver spots , and the fat deposits from years of abuse by eating Fudgicles and raw cookie dough when the wife was visiting her aunt in Philly . Now I was muscular and lean , not unlike Iggy Pop if he were younger and had never ridden the white horse . From that day on I became a better lover to my wife and a better father to my children . I ran for City Selectman and won in a landslide despite that old conviction in the 1970s for public urination on an officer of the law . I carry within me the spirit of the Lone Wolf , who understands that he does not need two other wolves at his side howling to the moon , but merely CHOOSES to be around others . Anytime I need reminding of this inner strength , I don the Howling Wolf T-shirt by The Mountain and I am once again swept away on a river of sobbing , howling , the song `` Alone Again ( Naturally ) \'\' by Gilbert O\'Sullivan , and finally ... redemption . The Three Wolf Moon shirt may appeal to the baser instincts of a boy \'s character , but once you \'re ready to become a Man , it \'s time to step up and try the Howling Wolf T-shirt 100 \% Cotton Short Sleeve . Also , every time I wear it I find money on the ground . ',ironisch

1017,46_12_R1UNQM7FPDC0MG.txt,' Sorry to see Charlaine Harris join the list of writers who are so driven by deadline pressure they ca n\'t create . Remember what we all learned in elementary school , faced with that blank sheet of paper ? You ca n\'t just order up creativity and expect it to be good . This is the third one of my favorite authors with series pressure to dissapoint . Beware when an author thanks so many other people for their `` help \'\' ! Last time I looked , most great fiction was not written by a committee . Harris is brilliant , when Harris is writing . This looked like an outline , with some help from Harris and a lot of suggestions from other people . People saying , write about Alcide . Write about politics . Write about fairy politics , etc . There is no plot , no main conflict , no main resolution , no basic novel elements . And we know Harris can write one hell of a plot when she is on her game . I would rather the publisher just said `` Harris has writer \'s block \'\' than churn out this overpriced drivel with her name on it . I would be willing to wait .
